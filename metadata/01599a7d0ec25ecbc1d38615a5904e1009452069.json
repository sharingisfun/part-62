Nanocomposite films and coatings achieve much more than the simple addition of the constitutents â€” the law of summation fails to work in the nano-world. This book encompasses three major parts of the development of nanocomposite films and coatings: the first focuses on processing and properties, the second concentrates on mechanical performance, and the third deals with functional performance, including wide application areas ranging from mechanical cutting to solar energy and from electronics to medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01599a7d0ec25ecbc1d38615a5904e1009452069","amp;dn":"Nanocomposite+Thin+Films+and+Coatings+-+Processing%2C+Properties+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01599a7d0ec25ecbc1d38615a5904e1009452069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,89,154,125,14,194,94,203,193,211,134,21,165,144,78,16,9,69,32,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
