Thank You!!!\r\n\r\nI work on my own so that I get all the credit for my hard work each and every week!!! \r\n\r\nBest Played With Media Player Classic or VLC Player \r\n\r\n\r\nNext week on July 12 will be the LAST TNA Impact Wrestling show I watch and capture if they choose to go head to head with a LIVE Smackdown show on Tuesday night July 19 from 8-10 pm. IF they switch to 10pm-12 am I will still watch and capture it. I capture live wrestling tv shows with special HD capturing equipment onto my pc hard drives here and I can only capture 1 channel at a time since my cable company won't provide me with a HD DVR to allow 2 shows to be recorded at the same time and if given the choice I will always capture a WWE show over TNA. If TNA has any brains they will move the show to a time slot when they don't go head to head with WWE Smackdown Live because let me be honest while I like TNA the simple fact is IF I can only watch and capture 1 show and its Smackdown or Impact then I'm choosing Smackdown. IF you have any thoughts then please leave a comment on my userpage on KAT thank you for understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nStoneCold420 \r\nSmackDownHotel\r\nJuly 5, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n@SCSA420 on Twitter\r\n\r\n\r\nFor SC-SDH releases find me on KAT at  https://kat.cr/user/SCSA420 or on ThePirateBay at https://thepiratebay.org/user/SCSA420","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71208cbd83cf1c87a2b705b3e7cd5d6452ef9dfa","amp;dn":"TNA+Impact+Wrestling+HDTV+2016-07-05+720p+H264+AVCHD-SC-SDH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71208cbd83cf1c87a2b705b3e7cd5d6452ef9dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,32,140,189,131,207,28,135,162,183,5,179,231,205,93,100,82,239,157,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
