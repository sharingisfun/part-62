Many legal observers believe that China will lose the arbitration case, putting paid to its oft-repeated pronouncements about how all of the South China Sea is Chinese. So does Beijing, which refused to participate in the proceedings and which for months has telegraphed that it also will refuse to abide by any ruling that goes against its interests. Such is the weakness of international law when placed against state policies. Perhaps worse, the ruling, whatever it decides, will not tackle the most explosive issues. The tribunal has already made it clear that it cannot rule on questions of sovereignty over specific territories. Further, it is unknown if the court will rule on the so-called â€œ9-Dash Lineâ€ claims of China to nearly the whole sea; any rejection of this claim would significantly undercut Beijingâ€™s position in the regionâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437684/east-asia-south-china-sea-conflict\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat makes Chinaâ€™s policy in the South and East China seas so curious is that it is so contrary to the governmentâ€™s description of its â€œpeaceful rise.â€ At the most recent meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations â€” a regional organization not notable for taking tough, principled stands on security issues â€” the group issued a unanimous condemnation of China before governments got cold feet and retracted it. Chinaâ€™s behavior is so egregious that other countries now blow up the countryâ€™s vessels captured in their waters. It should worry China that so many nations overpowered by it militarily and linked to it economically are willing to challenge it.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn the aftermath of the court decision, China likely will test the U.S.â€™ readiness to uphold the rules, creating military provocations that could escalate into war. It will redouble the use of civilian fishing fleets for military purposes and likely will try to intimidate Asian countries over which it has economic leverage. The government will argue that because the U.S. is not an Asian power, it should not be allowed to set the rules in Asiaâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schake-south-china-sea-ruling-20160714-snap-story.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a79198e2e4c07e9b5fa812458fabb025339b60b9","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+China+Rejects+Law+July+16.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a79198e2e4c07e9b5fa812458fabb025339b60b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,145,152,226,228,192,126,155,95,168,18,69,143,171,176,37,51,155,96,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
