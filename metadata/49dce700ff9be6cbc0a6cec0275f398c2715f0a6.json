Roscosmos Lunar Vaporware. Bob Zimmerman, Behindtheblack.com\r\nâ€œCosts rise on Obamaâ€™s asteroid mission\r\n\r\nThe year delay in Obamaâ€™s as yet unfunded unmanned asteroid mission, a preliminary to a proposed manned asteroid mission, has caused its budget to grow from $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion.\r\n\r\nMore significantly,\r\n\r\nNASAâ€™s cost estimate for [the unmanned] ARRM excludes launch and operations. In a March 2016 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of NASAâ€™s major programs showed a cost of $1.72 billion. Gates explained that the $1.72 billion includes the launch vehicle cost, set at approximately $500 million as a placeholder since NASA has not determined which of three launch vehicles will be used (Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy, or the Space Launch System).\r\n\r\nâ€¦The next administration will have to decide if the costs are worth the benefits. Although NASA has decided they are, the House Appropriations Committee disagrees. It denied funding for the program in its report on the FY2017 Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) appropriations bill, which funds NASA. The bill has not passed the House yet, however, and there is no similar language in the Senate version, so NASA is not currently prohibited from spending money on the project.\r\n\r\nSo far, NASA has been funding this Obama project by stealing money from other projects in NASA, since Congress has consistently refused to appropriate extra money for it. This approach has worked up until now, as they are only funding initial design work. Where they think they will get the money for a full mission however remains a complete mystery to me.\r\n \nhttp://behindtheblack.com/behind-the-black/points-of-information/costs-rise-on-obamas-asteroid-mission/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/\r\n\r\nTwitter: @batchelorshow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49dce700ff9be6cbc0a6cec0275f398c2715f0a6","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Nasa+Asteroid+Vaporware+Zimmerman.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49dce700ff9be6cbc0a6cec0275f398c2715f0a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,220,231,0,255,155,230,203,192,166,206,192,39,95,57,140,39,21,240,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
