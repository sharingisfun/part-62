In his lifetime, he had several champions but stood outside the musical mainstream, with his large-scaled, expressively grim scores. A Honegger pupil, his life wasn't easy: a violent, alcoholic father, and a mid-life diagnosis of crippling arthritis. Still, he continued composing to the end. His entire symphonic legacy--effectively 15, since the first and seventeenth were unfinished--have now been recorded complete, though a few have multiple recordings to their credit.\r\n\r\nPettersson's Tenth Symphony was composed during a nine-month stay in a hospital, being treated for a near-critical liver ailment caused by medicine used to treat his other existing conditions. It was to be his harshest symphony to date. According to his biograher, Pettersson called it his reaction to the outer world, while his Eleventh Symphony was his reaction to the inner world. Pettersson himself said in public that it was &quot;a fist to the face.&quot; It proved enormously popular, being given with a a few years in several dozen cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
