It is a part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. Windows 7 was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became generally available on October 22, 2009,[9] less than three years after the release of its predecessor, Windows Vista. Windows 7's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same time.\r\n\r\nWindows 7 was primarily intended to be an incremental upgrade to the operating system intending to address Windows Vista's poor critical reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility. Windows 7 continued improvements on Windows Aero (the user interface introduced in Windows Vista) with the addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows applications to be &quot;pinned&quot; to it, and new window management features. Other new features were added to the operating system, including libraries, the new file sharing system HomeGroup, and support for multitouch input. A new &quot;Action Center&quot; interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d347fe6db3b16858fa3f522c76fd50ae961ab370","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate+SP1+%2832+Bit%29+%5BDEVIOUS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d347fe6db3b16858fa3f522c76fd50ae961ab370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,71,254,109,179,177,104,88,250,63,82,44,118,253,80,174,150,26,179,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
