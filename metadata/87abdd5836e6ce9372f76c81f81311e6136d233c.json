But one day, while mining some rocks, he discovered a secret that would have better been hidden forever!\r\nThe Ancient Evil God, a huge sphinx with the power to destroy the world, wakes up from his eternal slumber and sends our hero into an adventure through time and space, where he will try to save all his companion workers and the world!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87abdd5836e6ce9372f76c81f81311e6136d233c","amp;dn":"Super+Helmets+on+Fire+DX+Ultra+Edition+Plus+Alpha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87abdd5836e6ce9372f76c81f81311e6136d233c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,171,221,88,54,230,206,147,114,247,108,129,248,19,17,230,19,109,35,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
