Five friends: Daulton, Zach, Ryan, Clay, and Justin have their entire lives within it's borders, mostly playing XBox in the clubhouse they've established in their perpetually absent friend Jake's garage. But this monotonous, predictable existence is shattered by the realization that Daulton is leaving for college in one week. His friends don't want him to go. They hatch a plan: for the next seven days they will do everything in their power to show Daulton that Peak Valley is better than any other place he could possibly go, so there's absolutely no reason to leave. And in seven days, anything can happen - Even in boring old Peak Valley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e907fc894a26f419b62f8823ea0c8e0e427f5abc","amp;dn":"Peak.Valley.2015.BrRip.GeekM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e907fc894a26f419b62f8823ea0c8e0e427f5abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,7,252,137,74,38,244,25,182,47,136,35,234,12,142,14,66,127,90,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
