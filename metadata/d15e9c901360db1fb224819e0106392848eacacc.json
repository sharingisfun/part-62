Formed in 2000, the band consists of Tommy Giles Rogers, Jr. (lead vocals, keyboards), Paul Waggoner (guitars, backing vocals), Dustie Waring (guitars), Dan Briggs (bass, keyboards), and Blake Richardson (drums).\r\n\r\nThe band was formed in 2000 in Raleigh, North Carolina after the demise of the metalcore band Prayer for Cleansing, in which Rogers and Waggoner were members of. Nick Fletcher, Jason King, and Will Goodyear subsequently joined on guitar, bass, and drums respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbums included:\r\n2002 - Between the Buried and Me\r\n2003 - The Silent Circus\r\n2005 - Alaska\r\n2006 - The Anatomy Of\r\n2007 - Colors\r\n2008 - Colors Live [Live]\r\n2009 - The Great Misdirect\r\n2011 - The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues [EP]\r\n2012 - The Parallax II: Future Sequence\r\n2015 - Coma Ecliptic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVogard7A forms discographies under the following standards:\r\n1. All studios songs must be present at 320kbps.\r\n2. Demos are not required, but if included they will be included as duplicates.\r\n3. Live albums are not required, but will be included if not difficult to find.\r\n4. If acoustic or instrumental versions are rare, then it is not necessary to include them.\r\n5. If some songs were never released in an LP or EP, i.e. from a soundtrack, then a &quot;Rare and Misc&quot; folder will include the overflow. Number is based on date they were created. If some songs were only ever included in Singles, they may or may not get a Single album, based on judgement.\r\n6. The goal is to be able to open a folder from your music player and have all of the songs available without duplicates. Because of this I will not include an identical song twice, with priority given to older album &gt; newer album &gt; EP &gt; Single.\r\n7. Metadata for all songs are edited by hand gathering information from sources like Wikipedia or Discogs.\r\n8. All Discographies are to be updated once a year in case of new albums, with the latest year in the title of the torrent.\r\n9. NEVER mention the name Vogard7A in any metadata or comments. I share music, I don't need to stamp my name on other peoples' great work.\r\n10. Include a playlist with my favorite songs from each band! You can delete this if it gets in the way.\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors (not subjective opinions about organization) drop a comment and I'll look at it before updating the Discography next year!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d15e9c901360db1fb224819e0106392848eacacc","amp;dn":"Between+the+Buried+and+Me+Discography+%282016%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d15e9c901360db1fb224819e0106392848eacacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,94,156,144,19,96,219,31,178,36,129,158,1,6,57,40,72,234,202,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
