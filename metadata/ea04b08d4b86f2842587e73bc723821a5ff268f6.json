Reinforced by concerns that Trump is biased against women and minorities, and would divide the country along racial lines as president, the hesitation about Trumpâ€™s qualifications go a long way toward explaining why he hasnâ€™t benefited more from the broad unease over the nationâ€™s direction and the negative views of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\r\nPermalink\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 12, 2016 at 8:05 AM\r\nRead it or Weep\r\nHow Global Elites Forsake Their Countrymen \r\nPeggy Noonan - Wall Street Journal\r\nThis is about distance, and detachment, and a kind of historic decoupling between the top and the bottom in the West that did not, in more moderate recent times, exist.\r\n\r\nRecently I spoke with an acquaintance of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and the conversation quickly turned, as conversations about Ms. Merkel now always do, to her decisions on immigration. Last summer when Europe was engulfed with increasing waves of migrants and refugees from Muslim countries, Ms. Merkel, moving unilaterally, announced that Germany would take in an astounding 800,000. Naturally this was taken as an invitation, and more than a million came. The result has been widespread public furor over crime, cultural dissimilation and fears of terrorism. From such a sturdy, grounded character as Ms. Merkel the decision was puzzlingâ€”uncharacteristically romantic about people, how they live their lives, and history itself, which is more charnel house than settlement house.\r\n\r\nMs. Merkelâ€™s acquaintance sighed and agreed. Itâ€™s one thing to be overwhelmed by an unexpected force, quite another to invite your invaders in! But, the acquaintance said, he believed the chancellor was operating in pursuit of ideals. As the daughter of a Lutheran minister, someone who grew up in East Germany, Ms. Merkel would have natural sympathy for those who feel marginalized and displaced. Moreover she is attempting to provide a kind of counter-statement, in the 21st century, to Germanyâ€™s great sin of the 20th. The historical stain of Nazism, the murder and abuse of the minority, will be followed by the moral triumph of open arms toward the dispossessed. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s driving it, said the acquaintance.\r\n\r\nPermalink\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 10, 2016 at 3:54 PM\r\nRead it or Weep\r\nWho Got Us Into These Endless Wars? \r\nPatrick Buchanan - Real Clear Politics\r\n&quot;Isolationists must not prevail in this new debate over foreign policy,&quot; warns Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. &quot;The consequences of a lasting American retreat from the world would be dire.&quot;\r\n\r\nTo make his case against the &quot;Isolationist Temptation,&quot; Haass creates a caricature, a cartoon, of America First patriots, then thunders that we cannot become &quot;a giant gated community.&quot;\r\n\r\nPermalink\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 10, 2016 at 3:17 PM\r\nRead it or Weep\r\nWhy Hillary won't win \r\nTim Constantine - The Washington Times\r\nHillary Clinton is widely assumed to be the inevitable nominee of the Democratic Party in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Many believe sheâ€™ll win the general election as well.\r\n\r\nShe will not.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of reasons why Hillaryâ€™s candidacy is doomed from the minute it leaves the starting gate. Among them are her disconnect from the average American and the false media assumption that she is universally loved by all except the evil right.\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea04b08d4b86f2842587e73bc723821a5ff268f6","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingraham+August+12+Ruling+Elite+Republican+Brats.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea04b08d4b86f2842587e73bc723821a5ff268f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,4,176,141,75,134,242,132,37,135,231,59,199,35,130,26,95,242,104,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
