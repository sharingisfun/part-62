Issues raised include: would any other candidate have done better against Hillary than Trump; has the US forgotten about the Bible; how do Republicans bring moderates back into the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Hillary Clinton as a Model for Young Girls\r\nOne of the most oft-heard claims made by supporters of Hillary Clinton is what a positive role model she would be for young girls as president.\r\nThey say: â€œThen, my daughters will know that nothing is to too great for them to aspire to. A woman can indeed be president of the United States.â€\r\nSo goes the argument.\r\nAccording to the latest Quinnipiac University poll, women will vote for Clinton by 60 percent to 36 percent, a margin of 24 percent. In the last presidential election, the margin was 10 percent.\r\nIf the polls are accurate concerning the lopsided female support for Clinton, there are three likely reasons:\r\nâ€“Many women really want a woman president.\r\nâ€“Many women want this model for their daughters and all other girls.\r\nâ€“Some women who might have voted for a Republican male just wonâ€™t vote for Donald Trump.\r\nIn a previous column, I addressed the issue of how morally primitive it is for a woman to vote for a woman because of her gender. I will therefore only address the widespread notion that it will be very good for young girls if Clinton is elected because they will be able to realize that nothing in America is closed to them.\r\nGiven that the former secretary of state used her office to enrich herself and her husband; given that she so willfully compromised national security by setting up her own private email server in order to avoid congressional and public oversight; given that she has repeatedly lied about these actions; given that she lied to the mothers and fathers of the men killed by terrorists in Benghazi; and given that she has a long history of lying (a New York Times columnist called her a â€œcongenital liarâ€ in the 1990s), the notion of Clinton as a model for Americaâ€™s girls and young women is nothing, if not depressing. \nhttp://www.dennisprager.com/columns/\r\n  \nhttp://www.dennisprager.com/ \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Prager \nhttp://www.dennisprager.com/columns/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa29b3a41994ea0550bf2ace0814321b6370a4e","amp;dn":"Dennis+Prager+Sept+2+Open+Lines.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa29b3a41994ea0550bf2ace0814321b6370a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,162,155,58,65,153,78,160,85,11,242,172,224,129,67,33,182,55,10,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
