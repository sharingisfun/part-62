While trying to keep himself occupied (by writing secrets letters in French for his favorite nurse, which he parachutes to her hidden in a small bottle), he leaves the childrenâ€™s floor and enters a room downstairs in which an actor named Aktyorat (Kiril Variyski) is recovering from a serious trauma. Leonid is a boy with an attitude â€“ but as soon as the actor mentions pirates, his imagination goes wild and he makes the actor promise that he will tell him a story.\r\n\r\nReviews: \nhttps://www.theskykid.com/yo-ho-ho-1981/ \nhttp://www.gotterdammerung.org/film/reviews/y/yo-ho-ho.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3bb19de1bb86c1c2fbafd929dfe1748dac86e91","amp;dn":"Yo+ho+ho+%281981%29.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3bb19de1bb86c1c2fbafd929dfe1748dac86e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,187,25,222,27,184,108,28,47,186,253,146,157,254,23,72,218,200,110,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
