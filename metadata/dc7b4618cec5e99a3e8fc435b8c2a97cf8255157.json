Walter Huston, Oskar Homolka, Basil Sydney\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028176/\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1871, British adventurer Cecil Rhodes travels to South Africa where he ventures into the diamond mining business. Over the next several years, Rhodes takes over and consolidates numerous small diamond mines in the Kimberly fields. Alarmed by the power and wealth that Rhodes is amassing, Paul Kruger, the president of South Africa, attempts to head off Rhodes' political ambitions. A controversial figure, and not a particularly nice man, Cecil Rhodes has been considered one of the most remarkable imperialists in British history. He founded the De Beers diamond firm and Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) was named after him. In 2015, large crowds watched and cheered as his statue, already boarded up, was removed from the University of Cape Town.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 640x478, 25.000 fps, 1520 Kbps, 01h27m21s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 256 kbps\r\n\r\nTVRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/v8310cab5/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/f1tjdib5z/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/p0ehzzklj/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/5wl6jn7rb/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/a6zuf8cuf/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7b4618cec5e99a3e8fc435b8c2a97cf8255157","amp;dn":"Rhodes+of+Africa+%5B1936+-+UK%5D+%28Walter+Huston%29+biopic+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc7b4618cec5e99a3e8fc435b8c2a97cf8255157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,123,70,24,206,197,233,154,62,143,196,53,184,194,169,124,248,37,81,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
