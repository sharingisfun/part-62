Sooner or later it had to start, we moved to Mars, but began what we had feared. The war for water has ruined a lot of lives, dividing by many different barricades and harden the overall situation. You will manage one of tehnomantov, electricity masters. The choice will be given just three fighting styles. As enemies: all kinds of looters, not the most friendly, fauna and a couple of other factions. In the game there is a ramified network of dialogues and your choice will affect your future.
