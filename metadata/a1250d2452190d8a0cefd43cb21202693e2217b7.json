Featuring realistic natural environments and rich engaging combat, it blends PVP and PVE game play with resource gathering and detailed but easy to use crafting.\r\n\r\nThe Landscape is a smooth voxel terrain that you can mine for resources, make caves, destroy with weapons, blow up with explosives and place to build structures up to thousands of feet in any direction. Build towers miles tall and mine far into the depths of the earth with our easy to use terrain editing controls.\r\n\r\nRealism will be strived for but not allowed to stand in the way of fun. Game play will be tunable from highly realistic to arcade style fun by an easy to use modding system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1250d2452190d8a0cefd43cb21202693e2217b7","amp;dn":"Brutal+Nature+v0.61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1250d2452190d8a0cefd43cb21202693e2217b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,37,13,36,82,25,13,138,12,239,212,60,178,18,2,105,62,34,23,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
