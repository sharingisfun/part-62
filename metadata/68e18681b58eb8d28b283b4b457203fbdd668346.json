Dallâ€™Asta, F. Berthiller (RSC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThe first book to cover this fast developing field, Masked Mycotoxins in Food will provide a full overview of the issues relating to the toxicology of masked mycotoxins present in food products. Mycotoxins are naturally occurring chemicals produced by moulds that can grow on crops and foodstuffs. Masked mycotoxins are modified mycotoxins, due to this modification many cannot be detected using standard analytical techniques, for example HPLC and ELISA, and further research is needed to understand the health risks and threats from these modified compounds.Masked mycotoxin research is an area of toxicological research that has gained significant interest and momentum in recent years. The aim of this book is to provide a full picture of the topic, from the masked mycotoxin formation in plants to their catabolic fate in humans. The book also provides new insights and will highlight possible gaps in the knowledge base of this relatively new area. Edited and written by World renowned experts working within the field, this book is of interest to toxicologists and biochemists, but also food scientists and agricultural researchers working in industry and academia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e18681b58eb8d28b283b4b457203fbdd668346","amp;dn":"Masked+Mycotoxins+in+Food+-+C.+Dall%26rsquo%3BAsta%2C+F.+Berthiller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e18681b58eb8d28b283b4b457203fbdd668346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,225,134,129,181,142,184,210,139,40,59,75,69,114,3,251,221,102,131,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
