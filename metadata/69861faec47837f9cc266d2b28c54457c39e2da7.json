After a few years, scientific expeditions have tried to explain the origin of the accident, but could not come to any conclusions. However, in the mid-1940s, a team of scientists from the Russian special services investigating the explosion place, stumbled upon the wreckage of an alien spacecraft containing technology, well in excess of our own. Later, on the basis of these technologies, the KGB created a new secret weapon, known as O.S.O.\r\n\r\nFeatures of release:\r\nDo not cut\r\n\r\nDo not recoded\r\n\r\nSupport Language: English, German\r\n\r\nChanging the localization is carried out in the game settings\r\n\r\nThe path to save the game?\r\n\r\nGames Version: 0.1\r\n\r\nInstallation time: ~ 20 seconds\r\n\r\nThe installer sounds Kim Waters\r\n\r\nRelease from Other s\r\n\r\nScreenshots: \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aVPu \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aVPv \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aVPA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69861faec47837f9cc266d2b28c54457c39e2da7","amp;dn":"MechRunner+%282016%29+%5BEn%5D+%281.0%29+%28Repack+by+Other+s%29+Uploaded+by+Mon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69861faec47837f9cc266d2b28c54457c39e2da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,134,31,174,196,120,55,249,204,38,109,43,40,197,68,87,195,158,45,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
