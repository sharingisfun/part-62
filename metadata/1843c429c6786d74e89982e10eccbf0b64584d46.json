Three Days of the Condor for President. @billroggio @joshrogin\r\nThe Islamic State frequently accuses al Qaedaâ€™s leaders of being â€œdeviantsâ€ and argues that al Qaeda has fallen into a state of â€œnonbelief.â€ Zawahiri challenges Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and his men to provide proof of al Qaedaâ€™s supposed ideological lapses. Zawahiri mentions a â€œmartyrâ€ known as Abu Saâ€™d al Hadrami, saying the Islamic State falsely accused him of being a â€œnonbelieverâ€ because he accepted pledges of allegiance from members of the Free Syrian Army. Hadrami was an Al Nusrah Front commander in Raqqa, Syria who was killed by the Islamic State early on in its rivalry with Zawahiriâ€™s loyalists.\r\n\r\nThe al Qaeda master warns all of the Islamic Stateâ€™s followers that they risk being found â€œcomplicitâ€ in the â€œcrimesâ€ ordered by the groupâ€™s leadership. Zawahiri demands that Baghdadi provide the names and biographies of all the men (a â€œminorityâ€) who swore allegiance to Baghdadi and declared him â€œCaliph Ibrahim.â€ In particular, Zawahiri says that all â€œthose who were members of Saddamâ€™s Armyâ€ and even â€œmore so those who were in Saddamâ€™s intelligenceâ€ service should be identified. By highlighting the role of former members of Saddam Husseinâ€™s regime in Baghdadiâ€™s Islamic State, Zawahiri attempts to undermine its legitimacy. He implicitly argues that former Baathists and other members of Saddamâ€™s military and intelligence service are not fit to name a â€œcaliphâ€ who supposedly rules over all Muslims.\r\n \nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/zawahiri-calls-on-muslims-to-support-taliban-reject-islamic-state.php\r\n\r\nThe familyâ€™s entertainment budget consisted of renting VHS tapes from Blockbuster. In middle school, he saw â€œThree Days of the Condorâ€ and decided he wanted to be a CIA agent. He reached out to the CIA recruiter in high school and was already working with the agency in college, when the attacks of 9/11 happened. After spending two years in southern Brazil on his Mormon mission, McMullin joined the CIA full time and began working overseas on counterterrorism operations.\r\n\r\nAfter about a decade of service, he decided he wanted a shot at a normal life. He returned to the United States, went to business school and got a job at Goldman Sachs. He volunteered to help out with the Romney campaign part-time. Those connections eventually led to a job working for House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.).\r\n\r\nWhile in Congress, McMullinâ€™s passion was Syria. Frustrated by what he saw as Americaâ€™s tragic neglect of the suffering of the Syrian people, he was doing everything he could to raise awareness of the Syrian conflict and push Congress to take action. McMullin was instrumental in bringing to Congress a Syrian defector nicknamed â€œCaesar,â€ who fled his country with more than 55,000 photographs showing evidence of mass torture and murder of more than 11,000 civilians in custody in Bashar al-Assadâ€™s prisons.\r\n \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2016/08/22/the-story-behind-evan-mcmullins-run-for-president/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1843c429c6786d74e89982e10eccbf0b64584d46","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+22+Al+Qaeda+Disdains+ISIS+Taliban.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1843c429c6786d74e89982e10eccbf0b64584d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,67,196,41,198,120,109,116,232,153,130,225,14,204,191,11,100,88,77,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
