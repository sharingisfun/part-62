Just\r\nwait until you re surrounded by fire, spinning saw-blades, crushing\r\nspikes, incinerators, lasers, and more!\r\n\r\nSeriously, why does Evil Inc. even have things that exist solely to\r\ncrush whatever s in front of them? That s evil\r\n\r\nCrates explode to set their neighbors on fire, and flammable goo\r\nhelps keep the destruction going.
