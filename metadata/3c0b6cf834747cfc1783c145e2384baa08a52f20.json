In his lifetime, he had several champions but stood outside the musical mainstream, with his large-scaled, expressively grim scores. A Honegger pupil, his life wasn't easy: a violent, alcoholic father, and a mid-life diagnosis of crippling arthritis. Still, he continued composing to the end. His entire symphonic legacy--effectively 15, since the first and seven th were unfinished--have now been recorded complete, though a few have multiple recordings to their credit.\r\n\r\nPettersson's Eleventh Symphony was composed during a lengthy hospital stay, while he was being treated for a near-critical liver ailment brought on by medicine used to treat other existing conditions. If the Tenth was, as Pettersson informed his biographer, his reaction to the outer world, his Eleventh was his reaction to the inner world. Harshness exists in it, but not the unrelenting hammer blows that led the composer to refer to the Tenth as &quot;a fist to the face.&quot; Like the Tenth, the Eleventh proved very popular.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
