The disruption distracted Kurt allowing Rey Mysterio to execute his infamous 619 finishing move to pin Kurt for a 3 count to win the fight. The fracas drove fans crazy creating a viral moment and setting the stage for the release of RiFFâ€™s new project also called The Peach Panther. With the release of â€œCarlos Slim,â€ the first single off the new LP, RiFF RAFF also announced the creation of Neon Nation Corporation The $4 million joint venture will be head up by Russell Redeaux of Stampede Management and long time manager for Riff Raff; and Riff Raff, who brings his social media expertise, his Neon Nation army of fans, and trail blazing creative vision to form this amazing new label. Neon Nation Corporation was able to strike a distribution/marketing deal with BMG, starting with Riff Raffâ€™s highly anticipated album The Peach Panther scheduled for release in June. RiFF RAFFâ€™s sophomore album includes guest performances from G-Eazy, Gucci Mane, Lil Durk, J Doe, &amp; Danny Brown. The project will include a â€œPeach Pantherâ€ film, a US summer headline tour of the same name, four music videos to support album, and more.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1.
