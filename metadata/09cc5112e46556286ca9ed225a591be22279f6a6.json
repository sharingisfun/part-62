Three cameras filmed two emotional hours without any plans of what the tapes would be used for. In 2002 dedicated fans started a petition to have the tapes released and three years later the &quot;Seigmen DVD petition&quot; had almost 2000 signatures. Seigmen's reunion in 2005 gave life to the idea of making a DVD and through ten months of intense work, the producers PÃ¥l Martin Rossing and Lars Martin KrÃ¦mer have taken the project from just being an idea and to the biggest and most ambitious music DVD that has been produced about a Norwegian band ever.\r\n\r\n&quot;Fra X Til DÃ¸den&quot; gives you the reunion concert at DÃ¸dens Dal in front of 5300 ecstatic fans, filmed with 14 cameras and in 5.1 Dolby surround.\r\n\r\nHere you can see the practice room some months before the concert while the band is working on getting ready and heal old wounds. Here are lots of bonus stuff like music videos, picture gallery, old live clips and private filming of the recording of &quot;Metropolis&quot;.
