He is known for his socially critical directing style and for his socialist ideals, which are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as poverty, homelessness (Cathy Come Home, 1966) and labour rights (Riff-Raff, 1991, and The Navigators, 2001).\r\n\r\nLoach's film Kes (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) and I, Daniel Blake (2016) received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the ninth filmmaker to win the prestigious award twice.\r\n\r\nThis film documents the life and times of Ken Loach, his politics in British TV and cinema, and the chaos he caused the establishment for 50 years.\r\n\r\n&quot;Versus: The Life and Films of Ken Loach&quot; (2016) at IMDB: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5536398/\r\n\r\nKen Loach at Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Loach\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nGeneral Video Codecs Used.................................AVC\r\n\tAudio Codecs Used.................................AAC LC\r\n\tFile Format.......................................MPEG-4\r\n\tPlay Time.........................................1h 29mn\r\n\tTotal File Size...................................1.49 GiB\r\n\tTotal Stream BitRate..............................2392 Kbps\r\n\tTitle (Tag).......................................Versus - The Life and Films of Ken Loach\r\n\tEncoded with......................................Lavf52.94.0\r\n\r\nVideo Stream\r\n\tCodec (Human Name)................................AVC\r\n\tCodec (FourCC)....................................avc1\r\n\tCodec Profile.....................................  \r\n\tFrame Width.......................................1280 pixels\r\n\tFrame Height......................................720 pixels\r\n\tFrame Rate........................................25.000 fps\r\n\tDisplay Aspect Ratio..............................16:9\r\n\tVideo Stream BitRate Mode.........................VBR\r\n\r\nAudio Stream\r\n\tCodec.............................................AAC\r\n\tCodec (FourCC)....................................40\r\n\tAudio Stream BitRate Mode.........................VBR\r\n\tNumber of Audio Channels..........................2\r\n\tAudio Channel's Positions.........................Front: L R\r\n\tSampling Rate.....................................48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0df1bf818010a241f4900ef67a422f11f9b66ec7","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Films+of+Ken+Loach+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0df1bf818010a241f4900ef67a422f11f9b66ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,241,191,129,128,16,162,65,244,144,14,246,122,66,47,17,249,182,110,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
