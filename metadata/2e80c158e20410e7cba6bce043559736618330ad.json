The story was based upon the Barbie and the Rockers line of dolls, which featured Barbie as the leader of a rock band. The special originally aired in syndication as a two-part TV &quot;mini-series&quot; with each installment lasting approximately 25 minutes; part two was entitled &quot;Barbie and The Sensations: Rockin' Back to Earth&quot;. This miniseries was supposed to have been the pilot for a Monday-Friday Barbie cartoon series. Unfortunately, negotiations between DIC and Mattel fell through, and the project eventually emerged with a whole new set of characters â€” and the sponsorship of Mattel rival Hasbro â€” as Maxie's World in 1988.[3] The story was based on the Barbie and the Rockers doll line in which Barbie is the lead singer of a rock band. The two-part special was later released on video as a single movie by Hi-Tops Video.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313254/\r\nBarbie and her band, The Rockers preform a charity concert in outer space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e80c158e20410e7cba6bce043559736618330ad","amp;dn":"Barbie+and+the+Rockers+Out+of+This+World.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e80c158e20410e7cba6bce043559736618330ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,128,193,88,226,4,16,231,203,166,188,224,67,85,151,54,97,131,48,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
