To myself drum and bass didn't exist yet. I had gone to this mixtape store again and again asking for breakbeat hardcore and finally this was the newest Dara tape they had. It wasn't however, breakbeat hardcore. You wanna profile this actually, bottle it and sell it. Kid, not yet 18. Can't go to clubs doesn't know where the outlaws are. WANTS MORE BREAKBEAT HARDCORE like it was a religion or something.\r\n\r\nAt this point I was still confused. I didn't understand how records worked. It was like magic, how do they get those sounds out up there is there a machine that makes this sound? I was thinking live PA but I didn't know what that was. It wouldn't have helped.\r\n\r\nSo this is a 90 minute mixtape that possibly represents something significant. Breakbeat hardcore was evolving into drum and bass. If 1993 was before and 1996 was after then this was something you should hear.\r\n\r\nDJ Dara - Rise 2 Da Bass side a\r\n\r\nJacob's Ladder\r\nFlashback\r\nLove to Keep\r\nSea of Destiny\r\nA21\r\nThe Killer (rmx)\r\nFucking Hardcore\r\nGive Yourself\r\nDarkside\r\nTales from the Dark (rmx)\r\nDrums of Doom\r\nLove for the World (rmx)\r\nLove My Dub\r\nMusic Makers\r\n\r\nDJ Dara - Rise 2 Da Bass side b\r\n\r\nWhite Label\r\nAge of Aquarius\r\nRugged Promo\r\nDope on Plastic 3\r\nHypnosis\r\nThis is the Way\r\nWeird Energy (rmx)\r\nVexed\r\nGive it up\r\nSurrender\r\nCalling the People\r\nBat 21\r\n\r\nFrom House 84 east 7th Street, NYC year 1994","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2e0ccf7e21f299afd7738dcafbf4c29029f53e","amp;dn":"DJ+Dara+-+Rise+2+Da+Bass+1994+%5BFLAC%5D+%28drumnbass%29+MIXTAPE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2e0ccf7e21f299afd7738dcafbf4c29029f53e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,46,12,207,126,33,242,153,175,215,115,141,202,251,244,194,144,41,245,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
