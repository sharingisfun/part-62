In his lifetime, he had several champions but stood outside the musical mainstream, with his large-scaled, expressively grim scores. A Honegger pupil, his life wasn't easy: a violent, alcoholic father, and a mid-life diagnosis of crippling arthritis. Still, he continued composing to the end. His entire symphonic legacy--effectively 15, since the first and seventeenth were unfinished--have now been recorded complete, though a few have multiple recordings to their credit.\r\n\r\nPettersson's 15th Symphony was the next to last he lived to complete. After the knotty textures and extreme tension of the three preceding works, it comes off as more relaxed, if certainly not genial. Pettersson still had much to say, but in this work he found a gentler way to say it.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
