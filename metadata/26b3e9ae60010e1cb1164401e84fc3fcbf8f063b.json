No funds to manage or infrastructures to build. Itâ€™s a kill or be killed battle of rapid decisions to dominate the gene pool.\r\n\r\nKepler 42-C. A faraway planet of little significance. At least, it was until a malfunctioning drone crashed into its ocean, forever altering the course of life and inciting a battle to claim the planet, one microorganism at a time.\r\n\r\nClaim vital positions to replicate and mutate into seven specialized units, such as the fast and vulnerable Scout, the explosive Kamikaze, and the life-draining Leach. Press your enemies for weaknesses, outflank their ambushes, usurp their bases, and amass an unstoppable swarm to overpower your adversaries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b3e9ae60010e1cb1164401e84fc3fcbf8f063b","amp;dn":"Boid+v0.9.044","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b3e9ae60010e1cb1164401e84fc3fcbf8f063b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,179,233,174,96,1,14,28,177,22,68,1,232,79,195,252,191,143,6,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
