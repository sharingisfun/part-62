Counter-intelligence specialist Lee Barrett (George Maharis) is called in to work with the regular security and intelligence personnel in determining who has the deadly substances, and why. Working with him is Ann (Anne Francis), an old flame and the daughter of the man (Dana Andrews) handling this on behalf of Washington -- working against them are a pair of psychopaths (Frank Sutton, Ed Asner) reporting to a mysterious financier, Charles Reynolds Ainsley, who has an agenda he's keeping secret for now. And the sidelines are populated by a group of flustered scientists (Richard Basehart, Simon Oakland, Harold Gould) and administrators (John Larkin, John Anderson), one of whom knows a lot more than he's telling about why the Satan Bug was stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: George Maharis, Richard Basehart, Anne Francis\r\nDIRECTOR......: John Sturges\r\nWRITERS.......: James Clavell, Edward Anhalt\r\nGENRE.........: Sci-Fi | Crime | Mystery\r\nIMDB RATING...: 6.2/10  1619 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059678\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 54mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.12GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x816\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.35:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 3000 Kbps (3-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English E-AC3 2.0 Mono 320kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with film critic Glenn Erickson\r\nSUBTITLES.....: No   \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Kino Lorber Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-08-26","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593d715868a2a026b1422c4f78ef3bc1e3ba37c9","amp;dn":"The.Satan.Bug.1965.1080p.BluRay.x264.EAC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593d715868a2a026b1422c4f78ef3bc1e3ba37c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,61,113,88,104,162,160,38,177,66,44,79,120,239,59,193,227,186,55,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
