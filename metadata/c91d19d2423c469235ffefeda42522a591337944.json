My first torrent is located at http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/2133070. If you liked those, my third torrent is at http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/2202988.\r\n\r\nHey, this is my second collection of Japanese SNES roms that have been translated into English. I have done all the necessary patching, so there is no fooling with IPS or UPS files required. I made this because many people have problems figuring out how to patch their roms. Included with the roms are two emulators that I use, ZSNES (the one that I mainly use, because it has extremely low system requirements,) and SNES9x (which plays some games more accurately than ZSNES.) There are two versions of SNES9x included, the Windows 32 bit version for XP and up, and the Windows 9x version for Windows ME and Windows 98. I downloaded the patches for these games from http://www.romhacking.net. You can find a few more translated games on that site that I did not include here.. although I don't really like any of the ones that I haven't uploaded between this torrent and my other one.\r\n\r\nThe roms included are:\r\n\r\nBrandish 2 - The Planet Buster.smc\r\nBreath of Fire II.smc\r\nCu-On-Pa SFC.smc\r\nCyber Knight.smc\r\nCyber Knight II - Ambitions of the Terran Empire.smc\r\nDark Law - Meaning of Death.smc\r\nDo-Re-Mi Fantasy - Milon's Quest.smc\r\nJelly Boy 2.smc\r\nJerry Boy.smc\r\nJuutei Senki.smc\r\nKing of Demons.smc\r\nMagna Braban - The Wandering Hero.smc\r\nMobile Suit Gundam - Cross Dimension 0079.smc\r\nMonstania.smc\r\nPopeye - Tale of Teasing Witch Sea Hag.smc\r\nRanma Ã‚Â½ - Treasure of the Red Cat Gang.smc\r\nShin Megami Tensei.smc\r\nShin Megami Tensei II.smc\r\nSuper Gussun Oyoyo 2.smc\r\nSuper Robot Wars 3.smc\r\nTales of Phantasia.smc\r\nTenchi Muyou!.smc\r\nThe Violinist of Hamelin.smc\r\nWonder Project J - Machine Boy Pino.smc\r\nYs IV - Mask of the Sun.smc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91d19d2423c469235ffefeda42522a591337944","amp;dn":"Translated+Japanese+SNES+roms+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91d19d2423c469235ffefeda42522a591337944","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,29,25,210,66,60,70,146,53,255,239,237,164,37,34,165,145,51,121,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
