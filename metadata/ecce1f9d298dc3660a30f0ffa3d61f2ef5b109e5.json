Sawyer\r\n&quot;The history of China is a history of warfare. Rarely in its 3,000-year existence has the country not been beset by war, rebellion, or raids. Warfare was a primary source of innovation, social evolution, and material progress in the Legendary Era, Hsia dynasty, and Shang dynasty--indeed, war was the force that formed the first cohesive Chinese empire, setting China on a trajectory of state building and aggressive activity that continues to this day.\r\n\r\nIn Ancient Chinese Warfare, a preeminent expert on Chinese military history uses recently recovered documents and archaeological findings to construct a comprehensive guide to the developing technologies, strategies, and logistics of ancient Chinese militarism. The result is a definitive look at the tools and methods that won wars and shaped culture in ancient China.&quot;\r\n\r\nNicola Di Cosmo, Henry Luce Foundation Professor of East Asian History at the Institute for Advanced Study\r\n\r\nâ€œAncient Chinese Warfare is an important, informative, and exciting book. Written with panache, brimming with new ideas, and based on a level of knowledge that would challenge any expert, Sawyerâ€™s work has transformed single-handedly our understanding of ancient Chinese military history. Readers will find in this book a solidly informed and vivid account of Chinaâ€™s ways of warfare from the Shang dynasty to the mid-first millennium BC. Only few of them will appreciate the massive effort of synthesis and analysis that this book represents, and it is to Sawyerâ€™s credit that he has succeeded in bringing an extremely difficult topic to a level that everyone can understand, learn from, and enjoy.â€\r\n\r\nEdward N. Luttwak, author of The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire\r\n\r\nâ€œNot unexpectedly, this book enhances Ralph D. Sawyerâ€™s reputation as the premier interpreter of Chinese strategy and warfare. The surprise is that with the aid of a flowing style he has written a highly readable, indeed very enjoyable book on a seemingly abstruse subject. In a manner fascinating in itself, Sawyer brilliantly reconstructs the fragmentary archaeological evidence.â€\r\n\r\nLibrary Journal\r\n\r\nâ€œ[A] complex, fascinating book.... [R]eaders with a serious interest in Chinese history and/or warfare will appreciate Sawyerâ€™s work.â€\r\n\r\nMichigan War Studies Review â€œ[Ancient Chinese Warfare] marks a major advance in the state of our knowledge, a rich repository to be mined not only by historians of China but also world historians, scholars of comparative military history, and students of the origins of war and the state. Its impact will be substantial, far-reaching, and unsuperseded for many years to come.â€\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nRalph D. Sawyer has worked extensively with major intelligence and defense agencies, as well as lecturing and consulting internationally on China. A Fellow of the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, he is the translator of numerous books from the Chinese military corpus, including The Art of War. He lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecce1f9d298dc3660a30f0ffa3d61f2ef5b109e5","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+April+20+China+G20+Showdown.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecce1f9d298dc3660a30f0ffa3d61f2ef5b109e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,206,31,157,41,141,195,102,10,48,240,255,163,214,31,46,245,177,9,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
