The World According to Obama. Michael Vlahos, Johns Hopkins\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦How the Obama administration sees the world\r\n\r\nThe basic starting point, according to Rice, is that the world is better than it ever has been â€” and itâ€™s getting better still:\r\n\r\nWe are in an era where, as the president has often said, if you didnâ€™t know who you were going to be, or whether you were going to be male or female; white, black, Asian, Native American, Latino, [or] something else; if you didnâ€™t know if you were going to be straight or gay â€” if you didnâ€™t know anything about who you were going to be and you had to pick a time in which to be bornâ€¦\r\n\r\nYou would pick this time. Because the odds of success for any individual are much higher in the aggregate than theyâ€™ve ever been.\r\n\r\nRiceâ€™s support for this theory was a series of rattled-off metrics.\r\n\r\n&quot;More people are free of poverty than ever before, conflict between states is less than ever before, technology is providing extraordinary opportunities for advancement, and health and agriculture and well-being,&quot; Rice says. &quot;Compare the era weâ€™re living in today to the losses we suffered in World War II or even in the Vietnam War, or compare the economic challenges we face now to the Great Depression.&quot;\r\n\r\nRice is right on the evidence. The number of people living at $1.25 per day or less declined by roughly 1.1 billion people between 1990 and 2015. The number of war deaths per 100,000 people worldwide has increased in the past three years, owing largely to the war in Syria, but is still far lower than it was even 20 years ago. Average global life expectancy worldwide was 48 in 1950; it was 71.4 in 2015.\r\n\r\nObama and his advisers see these improvements as the product of a network of global institutions and dominant ideas â€” things like the global free trade regime, the United Nations, Americaâ€™s alliance networks in Europe and East Asia, and the like. They believe this basic international order has worked to make the world a much better place than itâ€™s ever been.\r\n\r\nBecause Team Obama sees the worldâ€™s basic institutions through this very positive lens, theyâ€™re focused on protecting them. The most important foreign policy task, for Team Obama, is to make sure the world keeps getting better.\r\n\r\nThat means, first and foremost, protecting the current system from things that threaten it.\r\n\r\n&quot;We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability,&quot; Obama said in a 2014 address to the United Nations. &quot;We can shape the course of this century, as our predecessors shaped the post-World War II age.&quot;\r\n\r\nThink about the Obama administrationâ€™s stated priorities over the years: the pivot to Asia, the push for global climate change agreements, the nuclear negotiations with Iran. Each was designed to address something that could at least theoretically threaten important parts of the system: a conflict-ridden relationship with China, catastrophic climate change, a nuclear Iran.\r\n\r\nIn those cases, the Obama administration was willing to take risks and spearhead ambitious new policy initiatives, because the tail risk of inaction was extremely high.\r\n\r\nThe administration is less willing to act, by contrast, when it comes to immediate crises â€” significant problems that nonetheless donâ€™t pose systemic threats. The Obama administration has been very wary of getting pulled into a major involvement in Syria, for example, or a large-scale troop deployment to fight ISISâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12387600/susan-rice-vox\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nBy Olesya Astakhova and Andrew Osborn | BELBEK AIR BASE, CRIMEA/MOSCOW\r\n\r\nVladimir Putin flew into annexed Crimea on Friday a day after staging war games there, and said he hoped Ukraine would see &quot;common sense&quot; when it came to resolving a diplomatic crisis over the peninsula.\r\n \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-putin-idUSKCN10U16R?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FworldNews+%28Reuters+World+News%29\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\nRussiaâ€™s long-range bombers Tupolev-22M3 and frontline bombers Sukhoi-34 have dealt another strike against Islamic State targets in Syriaâ€™s Deir ez-Zor province from bases in Russia and Iran, the Russian Defense Ministry said.\r\n\r\n&quot;On August 18, 2016 long-range bombers Tupolev-22M3 and frontline bombers Sukhoi-34 took off from bases in Russia and Iran to deal a massive strike against the facilities of the Islamic State group (outlawed in Russia) in Syriaâ€™s Deir ez-Zor province,&quot; the Defense Ministry said in a news release.\r\n \nhttps://in.rbth.com/news/2016/08/18/russias-bombers-make-third-raid-from-airdrome-in-iran-to-attack-is_622171\r\n \nhttps://in.rbth.com/news/2016/08/18/russias-bombers-make-third-raid-from-airdrome-in-iran-to-attack-is_622171\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/\r\n\r\nTwitter: @batchelorshow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a593ac8ec75350da9d958bf15bed50ec9a59d8","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+2016+Eurasian+Guns+Michael+Vlahos.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a593ac8ec75350da9d958bf15bed50ec9a59d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,165,147,172,142,199,83,80,218,157,149,139,241,91,237,80,236,154,89,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
