Unique adaptation.  In this version the Hispaniola sails out of Dublin (instead of Bristol) and the good guys are seeking the treasure not for themselves but to buy arms for the Irish fighting for independence from England (1790s).  Young Hawkins is actually Jenny Hawkins, who signs on the Hispaniola as cabin boy &quot;Jim&quot; to be near her love, Dr. Livesey, a good guy fighting in the rebellion.  Squire Trelawney is a money-grubbing bad guy who funds the voyage and supports the English.  Pirate Israel Hands is fond of the opening line from Psalm 132.  None of the good guys ever quote the Bible (of course).  Part comedy, part musical, you will see pirates singing and dancing.  Good English subtitles.  This the original, not the later VHS or DVD with different vocals for the songs and with minor edits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b2bcc07ca1c5429881882627bfa425bcd171670","amp;dn":"Treasure+Island+%28Russian+with+Engsubs+1938%29+TVrip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b2bcc07ca1c5429881882627bfa425bcd171670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,43,204,7,202,28,84,41,136,24,130,98,123,250,66,91,205,23,22,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
