From the fastest frigates to the gigantic, miles-long battleships, the player will customize all aspects of his ships: weaponry, defense and support sub-systems, but also crew, captains, and more... each customization affecting the very performances of the ship and the special abilities available during battle. From battle to battle, the admirals and crew of surviving ships will gain experience and promotions, improving the battle-readiness of the ships for future, bigger and more dangerous battles. \r\n\r\nAdditionally an extensive multiplayer mode with persistent fleets where up to 4 players can battle simultaneously, Battlefleet Gothic: Armada also features a big story campaign, taking place during the 12th Black Crusade and putting players in the middle of the Gothic War that raged between the Imperium and Abaddon the Despoiler. Players will be at the centre of every fight, commanding fleets of gigantic ships as the Chaos unleash a sequential chain of surprise attacks on Imperium worlds â€“ the start of 20 years of warring in the sector. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAn expansive single-player campaign across the Gothic sector. \r\nFour factions to command, each one with its own strengths and skills. \r\nTactical PVP multiplayer offering infinite replayability. \r\nA huge array of authentically recreated Battlefleet Gothic ships. \r\nA real-time strategy experience retaining many of the tactical Battlefleet Gothic elements.\r\nA plethora of lore-abiding skills to fill the playerâ€™s arsenal. \r\nUpgrade and apply skills at port Maw\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only) \r\nProcessor: AMD FX-4100 X4 (3,6 GHz)/Intel Core i5-2500 (3,3 GHz) \r\nMemory: 4096 MB RAM \r\nGraphics: 1 GB, DirectX 11, AMD Radeon HD 6850/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection \r\nStorage: 10 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED: \r\nOS: Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only) \r\nProcessor: AMD FX-8350 X8 (4,0 GHz)/Intel Core i7-3770 (3,9 GHz) \r\nMemory: 8192 MB RAM \r\nGraphics: 2 GB, DirectX 11, AMD Radeon R9 270X/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection \r\nStorage: 10 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd74b6e82b7119832fc3e455dccf445cde4c2775","amp;dn":"Battlefleet.Gothic.Armada.v1.6.8910.Cracked-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd74b6e82b7119832fc3e455dccf445cde4c2775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,116,182,232,43,113,25,131,47,195,228,85,220,207,68,92,222,76,39,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
