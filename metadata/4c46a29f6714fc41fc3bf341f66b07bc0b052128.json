Short of diving head-first from atop his eponymous tower, Donald J. Trump seems unable to satisfy the Never Trump crowd. Perhaps the most aggravating thing about Trumpâ€™s mortal enemies on the right â€” many of whom I have known and admired for decades â€” is that they refuse to take â€œyesâ€ for an answer. Mitt Romney, Senator Ted Cruz, columnist George Will, and others complain that Trump is a non-conservative, crypto-Democrat â€” Hillary Clinton with orange hair. No doubt, Trumpâ€™s trade policies violate conservative doctrine on the free exchange of goods and services across borders. Still, it was good to hear Trump say on Monday, â€œTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Up-- But Only By 3 pts\r\nIs the air going out of Hillary Clinton's post-convention bounce? The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online White House Watch survey of Likely U.S. Voters shows the Democratic nominee with 43% support to Donald Trump's 40%. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson picks up eight percent (8%) of the vote, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein trails with two percent (2%). Four percent (4%) like some other candidate, and three percent (3%) are undecided.\r\n\r\nHillary Wants to Win with Illegals\r\nHillary Clinton will step up Hispanic outreach in Florida this week around a trio of phone banks marking the four-year anniversary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama administration program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of youths from deportation.\r\n\r\nIllegal immigration surges past 2015 total--and still not over yet\r\nIllegal immigration in 2016 has already surpassed 2015 with two months still to go in the fiscal year, driven by a renewed surge of illegal immigrant children and families from Central America attempting to sneak into the U.S.\r\nAddThis Sharing Buttons\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c46a29f6714fc41fc3bf341f66b07bc0b052128","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingraham+August+15+%2C+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c46a29f6714fc41fc3bf341f66b07bc0b052128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,70,162,159,103,20,252,65,252,59,243,65,246,107,7,188,11,5,33,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
