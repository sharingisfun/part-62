I really didn't want to upload this since it is incomplete but I figure most of the show is better then NOT having it at all TNA Fans. I'm Sorry for the technical problem but it was beyond my control here. \r\n\r\nAs a special bonus for the technical problem tonight I am including the complete 17:56 version of The Directors Cut of The Final Deletion match.\r\n\r\nThe Final Deletion (Director's Cut)\r\nMatt Hardy \r\nvs \r\nJeff Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nJosh Mathews and The Pope call the action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is SDH release #2,219 for the wrestling fans from a wrestling fan.
