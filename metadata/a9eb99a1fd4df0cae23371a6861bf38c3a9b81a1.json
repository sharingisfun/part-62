Registering as lifeless and\r\npresumed automated, its journey through space puts it on a collision course with\r\nDaran 5, a heavily populated planet, in a year's time. Also with only year's time \r\nis Dr. McCoy, whose recent physical reveals an incurable malady. Kirk, Spock and\r\nMcCoy beam over to find the ship populated after all, by the descendants of the\r\nFabrini, en route to a new world. Kirk and company are welcomed to &quot;Yonada&quot; by\r\nNatira, the high priestess, who takes them to meet their oracle, a talking obelisk\r\nthat mets out strict rules and swift punishments. She is taken with McCoy, as he\r\nwith her. As Kirk and Spock's investigations commit a sacrilege that merits death,\r\nMcCoy decides to spend his remaining days aboard this doomed vessel with Natira.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\nComplete name : 310 - For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky.mkv\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFormat version : Version 2\r\nFile size : 493 MB\r\nDuration : 50min 45sec\r\nOverall bit rate : 1359 Kbps\r\nEncoded date : UTC 2016-08-30T15:03:34Z\r\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.10.5\r\nWriting library : Lavf55.12.0\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 7 frames\r\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nDuration : 50min 45sec\r\nBit rate : 1236 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1200 pixels\r\nHeight : 900 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\r\nCodec ID : A_AC3\r\nDuration : 50min 45sec\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 96.0 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits\r\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9eb99a1fd4df0cae23371a6861bf38c3a9b81a1","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+S03E10+%281968%29+-+BDRip+x264+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9eb99a1fd4df0cae23371a6861bf38c3a9b81a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,235,153,161,253,77,240,202,226,51,113,166,134,27,243,140,58,155,129,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
