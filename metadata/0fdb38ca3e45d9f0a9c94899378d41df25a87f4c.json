Part 1 of 2\r\n\r\nEmperor Nicholas I: Nicholas I (ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð¹ I ÐŸÐ°Ð²Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡, r Nikolai I Pavlovich; 6 July [O.S. 25 June] 1796 â€“ 2 March [O.S. 18 February] 1855) was the Emperor of Russia from 1825 until 1855. He was also the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland. He is best known as a political conservative whose reign was marked by geographical expansion, repression of dissent, economic stagnation, poor administrative policies, a corrupt bureaucracy, and frequent wars that culminated in Russia's disastrous defeat in the Crimean War of 1853-56. His biographer Nicholas V. Riasanovsky says that Nicholas displayed determination, singleness of purpose, and an iron will, along with a powerful sense of duty and a dedication to very hard work. He saw himself as a soldier â€“ a junior officer totally consumed by spit and polish. A handsome man, he was highly nervous and aggressive. Trained as an engineer, he was a stickler for minute detail. His reign had an ideology called &quot;Official Nationality&quot; that was proclaimed officially in 1833. It was a reactionary policy based on orthodoxy in religion, autocracy in government, and Russian nationalism.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was the younger brother of his predecessor, Alexander I. Nicholas inherited his brother's throne despite the failed Decembrist revolt against him and went on to become the most reactionary of all Russian leaders. His aggressive foreign policy involved many expensive wars, having a disastrous effect on the empire's finances.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter: @batchelorshow\r\n\r\nThe Romanovs: 1613-1918 by Simon Sebag Montefiore.Part 1 of 2.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Romanovs were the most successful dynasty of modern times, ruling a sixth of the worldâ€™s surface for three centuries. How did one family turn a war-ruined principality into the worldâ€™s greatest empire? And how did they lose it all?\r\n\r\nThis is the intimate story of twenty tsars and tsarinas, some touched by genius, some by madness, but all inspired by holy autocracy and imperial ambition. Simon Sebag Montefioreâ€™s gripping chronicle reveals their secret world of unlimited power and ruthless empire-building, overshadowed by palace conspiracy, family rivalries, sexual decadence and wild extravagance, with a global cast of adventurers, courtesans, revolutionaries and poets, from Ivan the Terrible to Tolstoy and Pushkin, to Bismarck, Lincoln, Queen Victoria and Lenin.\r\n\r\nTo rule Russia was both imperial-sacred mission and poisoned chalice: six of the last twelve tsars were murdered. Peter the Great tortured his own son to death while making Russia an empire, and dominated his court with a dining club notable for compulsory drunkenness, naked dwarfs and fancy dress. Catherine the Great overthrew her own husband (who was murdered soon afterward), enjoyed affairs with a series of young male favorites, conquered Ukraine and fascinated Europe. Paul I was strangled by courtiers backed by his own son, Alexander I, who in turn faced Napoleonâ€™s invasion and the burning of Moscow, then went on to take Paris. Alexander II liberated the serfs, survived five assassination attempts and wrote perhaps the most explicit love letters ever composed by a ruler. The Romanovs climaxes with a fresh, unforgettable portrayal of Nicholas II and Alexandra, the rise and murder of Rasputin, war and revolutionâ€”and the harrowing massacre of the entire family.\r\n\r\nDazzlingly entertaining and beautifully written from start to finish, The Romanovs brings these monarchsâ€”male and female, great and flawed, their families and courtsâ€”blazingly to life. Drawing on new archival research, Montefiore delivers an enthralling epic of triumph and tragedy, love and murder, encompassing the seminal years 1812, 1914 and 1917, that is both a universal study of power and a portrait of empire that helps define Russia today.â€\r\n\r\n \nhttp://JohnBatchelorShow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fdb38ca3e45d9f0a9c94899378d41df25a87f4c","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+aug+18+Romanovs.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fdb38ca3e45d9f0a9c94899378d41df25a87f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,219,56,202,62,69,217,240,169,201,72,153,55,141,65,223,37,168,127,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
