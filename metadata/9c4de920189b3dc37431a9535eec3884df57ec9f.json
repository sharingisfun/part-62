I have done all the necessary patching, so there is no fooling with IPS or UPS files required. I made this because many people have problems figuring out how to patch their roms. Included with the roms are two emulators that I use, ZSNES (the one that I mainly use, because it has extremely low system requirements,) and SNES9x (which I downloaded to play Fire Emblem, which would not play accurately under ZSNES.) There are two versions of SNES9x included, the Windows 32 bit version for XP and up, and the Windows 9x version for Windows ME and Windows 98. I downloaded the patches for these games from http://www.romhacking.net. You can find many more translated games on that site. This torrent only contains the roms that I have in my collection that I play and love.\r\n\r\nThe roms included are:\r\n\r\nBahamut Lagoon.smc\r\nChrono Trigger.smc\r\nDer Langrisser.smc\r\nDragon Quest III.smc\r\nDual Orb II.smc\r\nEmerald Dragon.smc\r\nFeda - The Emblem of Justice.smc\r\nFinal Fantasy IV.smc\r\nFinal Fantasy V.smc\r\nFinal Fantasy VI.smc\r\nFire Emblem 3 - Mystery of the Emblem.smc\r\nFront Mission - Gun Hazard.smc\r\nFront Mission.smc\r\nGo Go Ackman.smc\r\nLennus II - The Apostles of the Seals.smc\r\nLive A Live.smc\r\nMagic Knight Rayearth.smc\r\nMetal Max Returns.smc\r\nMystic Ark.smc\r\nRobotrek.smc\r\nStar Ocean.smc\r\nSuper Bomberman 4.smc\r\nSuper Bonk 2.smc\r\nTerranigma.smc\r\nThe Glory of Heracles.smc\r\nThe Legend of the Holy Sword 3.smc\r\nThe Magical Land of Wozz.smc\r\nTreasure of the Rudras.smc\r\n\r\nYes, I know there have been commercial English versions for Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. These are more accurate versions and the Final Fantasy VI rom has a few bug fixes applied to it as well, (although I left in the good old Vanish / X-Zone bug, I like that one.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c4de920189b3dc37431a9535eec3884df57ec9f","amp;dn":"Translated+Japanese+SNES+roms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c4de920189b3dc37431a9535eec3884df57ec9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,77,233,32,24,155,61,195,116,49,169,83,94,236,56,132,223,87,236,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
