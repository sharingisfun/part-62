Gregory Copley, Defense &amp; Foreign Affair\r\nâ€œâ€¦But the prospect of a Clinton election victory has reverberations in US policies toward Europe and the European Union, the UK, Asia, and the Middle East, where a continuation of the Obama/Clinton policies of the past eight years would be assumed to continue. This would imply:\r\n\r\n1.\tContinued pressure on, and isolation of, Israel;\r\n\r\n2.\tContinued economic sanctions against Russia, and pressures on the European Union to support those sanctions;\r\n\r\n3.\tContinued US isolation from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and a continued US reliance on Qatar as the major US â€œinstrumentâ€ for conducting indirect warfare in the region;\r\n\r\n4.\tContinued support for Turkey, even in the face of short-term mutual disagreements; certainly a determined effort by a Clinton White House to bolster NATO in its present form, with Turkey as a cornerstone component of the Alliance, regardless of whether or not Turkey acts as a reliable partner. That would also imply a refusal to help resolve the issue of the northern Cyprus occupation by Turkey;\r\n\r\n5.\tContinued support for Muslim Brotherhood groups and Brotherhood-linked governments given that this was largely a priority of Pres. Barack Obama, and given Mrs Clintonâ€™s deep ties to, and reliance on, Muslim Brotherhood-linked advisors;\r\n\r\n6.\tContinued commitment to a program to use proxy jihadist fighters to remove Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad from office;\r\n\r\n7.\tContinued degradation of the relative position of the Defense Dept. within the US strategic posture, implying ongoing stress on â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ within the Defense establishment, and a constraint on any radical new thinking to overturn the decline of efficacy of US military doctrine to meet the new era;\r\n\r\n8.\tA continuing degradation in the relative military position of the US vis-Ã -vis the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) would be assumed to continue, based on the performance of both powers over the past eight years, and based on Hillary Clintonâ€™s historical policy of curtailing professional leadership of the US Dept. of Defense and placing the State Dept. in a position of strategic policy ascendancy; and, among other things,\r\n\r\nContinued polarization of the US electorate, leading to increasing social disorder and a continuation of economic trends of the past eight yearsâ€¦â€\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/\r\n\r\nTwitter: @batchelorshow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:426320026f373b82472077248d5547da5e4d2533","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+20+HRC+Grand+Strategy.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"426320026f373b82472077248d5547da5e4d2533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,99,32,2,111,55,59,130,71,32,119,36,141,85,71,218,94,77,37,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
