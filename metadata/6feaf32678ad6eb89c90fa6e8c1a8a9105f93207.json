You can do a clean install and it'll be activated AFTER you've already upgraded to Windows 10 once or have bought a valid licence.\r\n\r\nif you've already upgraded Windows 7/8 Home etc use the Windows 10 Home install on booting the DVD or from USB. If you've upgraded Pro already use the Pro install.\r\n\r\nYou can make a USB install using Rufus which is free. \r\n \nhttps://rufus.akeo.ie/ Make a GPT USB key if your PC supports UEFI, make a MBR key if it doesn't support UEFI.\r\nBoot from USB using UEFI if you made a GPT USB. If you can't boot UEFI you never used the GPT option in RUFUS or your BIOS doesn't support UEFI.\r\n\r\nYou can use this free Hash Checker http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html to see the SHA1 of the ISO.\r\n\r\nCheck SHA-1 in Details on MSDN Website for the 1607 en-GB version.\r\n \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/downloads/#searchTerm=windows%2010%201607&amp;ProductFamilyId=0&amp;Languages=en&amp;Architectures=x64&amp;ProductFamilyIds=657&amp;FileExtensions=.iso&amp;PageSize=10&amp;PageIndex=0&amp;FileId=0\r\n\r\nPlease seed at least a 1:1 ratio.\r\n\r\nHope this helps some. \r\n\r\nEdit: You can download the official Windows 10 Anniversary Update .iso from here. \r\n \nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO/\r\n\r\nDifferent file name but same SHA-1 as the MSDN version. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6feaf32678ad6eb89c90fa6e8c1a8a9105f93207","amp;dn":"gb-en+Windows+10+Anniversary+Edition+July+Update+1607+Official+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6feaf32678ad6eb89c90fa6e8c1a8a9105f93207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,234,243,38,120,173,110,184,156,144,250,110,140,26,138,145,5,249,50,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
