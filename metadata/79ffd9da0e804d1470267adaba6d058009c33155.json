Origins of the famous tune on which it is based are somewhat unclear, but many believe it was composed by Busnois himself. His was definitely one of the first (if not the first) Masses to be composed on this tune, and another 40 or so were written subsequently by various composers of various nationalities. In fact, many of Busnois' works inspired emulations, and the other two works on this disc by him are equally mesmerising and exhilarating.\r\n\r\nThe Franco-Flemish composer Domarto also enjoyed considerable international repute in the mid-to-late fifteenth century, largely due to the popularity of the work by him presented on this disc.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore, together with Jean Pulloisâ€™ inspiring motet Flos de spina, a disc of some of the most important choral works from the fifteenth century, expertly and beautifully performed by one of the countryâ€™s leading exponents in this field, namely the Gramophone award-winning Binchois Consort","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ffd9da0e804d1470267adaba6d058009c33155","amp;dn":"Busnois+etc+-+Masses+-+Kirkman%2C+cond%3B+Binchois+Cnsrt+%28Philidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ffd9da0e804d1470267adaba6d058009c33155","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,255,217,218,14,128,77,20,112,38,122,218,186,109,5,128,9,195,49,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
