Wayne Morris, Virginia Grey, George Tobias\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044541/\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a government program in the mid-late 1800s, camels were imported to various regions of the American southwestern deserts as pack animals. Natives from the Middle Eastern countries came along as drivers and tenders. In this bizarre western, two prospectors strike it big and set out across Death Valley with their riches. They are chased by three Arabs astride camels. The locals who see the Arabs pass by mistake them for everything from Indians to the Three Wise Men. The prospectors are assisted by the real Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x540, 23.976 fps, 1800 Kbps, 01h11m16s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/4bizyi0d3/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/da554be1d/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/ltoj22mdt/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/8qswisw5t/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/yav6p8hjl/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e6f11b94f37b7437d768da399c5f1f7f1c4c6d","amp;dn":"Desert+Pursuit+%5B1952+-+USA%5D+%28Wayne+Morris%29+western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e6f11b94f37b7437d768da399c5f1f7f1c4c6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,230,241,27,148,243,123,116,55,215,104,218,57,156,95,31,127,28,76,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
