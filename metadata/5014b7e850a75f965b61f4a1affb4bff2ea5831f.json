Meshuggah's line-up consists of founding members vocalist Jens Kidman and lead guitarist Fredrik Thordendal, drummer Tomas Haake, who joined in 1990, rhythm guitarist MÃ¥rten HagstrÃ¶m, who joined in 1992 and bassist Dick LÃ¶vgren since 2004.\r\n\r\nMeshuggah first attracted international attention with the 1995 release Destroy Erase Improve for its fusion of fast-tempo death metal, thrash metal and progressive metal elements. Since its 2002 album Nothing, Meshuggah has switched from seven-string to downtuned eight-string guitars. Meshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style, complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. Meshuggah was labelled as one of the ten most important hard rock and heavy metal bands by Rolling Stone and as the most important band in metal by Alternative Press. Meshuggah has found little mainstream success as yet, but is a significant act in extreme underground music. Nevertheless, Meshuggah has begun to gain attention and respect among more mainstream audiences since the late 2000s, having also inspired the djent movement within progressive metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbums included:\r\n1991 - Contradictions Collapse\r\n1994 - None [EP]\r\n1995 - Destroy Erase Improve\r\n1997 - The True Human Design [EP]\r\n1998 - Chaosphere\r\n2001 - Rare Trax [Compilation]\r\n2002 - Nothing\r\n2002 - Nothing [Remastered]\r\n2004 - I [EP]\r\n2005 - Catch Thirtythree\r\n2008 - obZen\r\n2010 - Alive [Live]\r\n2012 - Koloss\r\n2013 - Pitch Black [EP]\r\n\r\n\r\nVogard7A forms discographies under the following standards:\r\n1. All studios songs must be present at 320kbps.\r\n2. Demos are not required, but if included they will be included as duplicates.\r\n3. Live albums are not required, but will be included if not difficult to find.\r\n4. If acoustic or instrumental versions are rare, then it is not necessary to include them.\r\n5. If some songs were never released in an LP or EP, i.e. from a soundtrack, then a &quot;Rare and Misc&quot; folder will include the overflow. Number is based on date they were created. If some songs were only ever included in Singles, they may or may not get a Single album, based on judgement.\r\n6. The goal is to be able to open a folder from your music player and have all of the songs available without duplicates. Because of this I will not include an identical song twice, with priority given to older album &gt; newer album &gt; EP &gt; Single.\r\n7. Metadata for all songs are edited by hand gathering information from sources like Wikipedia or Discogs.\r\n8. All Discographies are to be updated once a year in case of new albums, with the latest year in the title of the torrent.\r\n9. NEVER mention the name Vogard7A in any metadata or comments. I share music, I don't need to stamp my name on other peoples' great work.\r\n10. Include a playlist with my favorite songs from each band! You can delete this if it gets in the way.\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors (not subjective opinions about organization) drop a comment and I'll look at it before updating the Discography next year!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5014b7e850a75f965b61f4a1affb4bff2ea5831f","amp;dn":"Meshuggah+Discography+%282016%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5014b7e850a75f965b61f4a1affb4bff2ea5831f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,20,183,232,80,167,95,150,91,97,244,161,175,251,75,255,46,165,131,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
