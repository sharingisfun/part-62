The company developed the game and a mouse hardware to be used with it and as they realized the licensing will be impossible (and insane to be honest) they tried to enter the market with a â€œPS Compatible Versionâ€, basically meaning playable in consoles that were modified in order to bypass copyright restrictions and avoid legal infringements. The amount of units released was very short basically sent as a sample to market response research within distributors around the globe not being superior to 50 units.\r\n \nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/131920679756","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41afbf0cd7ff6a1d2db1c7bad4d060f0f496590e","amp;dn":"Photo+Hunter+Pokemon+Edition+%28U%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41afbf0cd7ff6a1d2db1c7bad4d060f0f496590e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,175,191,12,215,255,106,29,45,177,199,186,212,208,96,240,244,150,89,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
