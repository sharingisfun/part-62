Most relaxation studies deal with the relaxation changes of a single definite material property, and not with a wider spectrum of physical properties integrated into a common framework. This book shows that it is possible to describe these property changes on the basis of a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of their mechanism","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b6a27282234df5f055a24e93c11d528b7b355e7","amp;dn":"Glassy+Metals+-+Krassimir+Russew%2C+Liljana+Stojanova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b6a27282234df5f055a24e93c11d528b7b355e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,106,39,40,34,52,223,95,5,90,36,233,60,17,213,40,183,179,85,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
