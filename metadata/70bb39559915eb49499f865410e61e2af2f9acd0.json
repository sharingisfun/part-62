Go to Youtube and Dailymotion for other useful material.\r\n\r\nThese are DVD files but compressed by about half by Cinema Craft Encoder i.e they are as good as the originals.\r\n\r\nIn ebooks I am also uploading a collection of books on Degas. Kindly seed (and note that when the upload is complete, I will only be able to continue seeding for a week or two.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70bb39559915eb49499f865410e61e2af2f9acd0","amp;dn":"Edgar+Degas+-+Documentary+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70bb39559915eb49499f865410e61e2af2f9acd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,187,57,85,153,21,235,73,73,159,134,84,16,230,30,42,242,249,172,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
