Has the greatest media onslaught of all time (aided and abetted, it must be said, by the candidate himself) failed to convince you that Donald Trump is 1) unstable 2) a bigot 3) in league with Vladimir Putin 4) a demagogue 5) a Nazi or worse?\r\n\r\nIf your mind is still open, here are five reasons why a sane person might pull the lever for Trumpâ€¦.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court. As I and many others have argued, no matter what you think of Donald Trumpâ€™s personality, those who believe in free markets, limited government and in protecting our constitution cannot allow Hillary Clinton to appoint as many as four liberal Supreme Court Justices in the next few years. Her choices for decades will tilt the country even further towards a progressive agenda and weaken the checks and balances, which have powerfully limited the autocratic rule of Barack Obama. This is not acceptable. Trump would work to balance the court and free it ideology.\r\n\r\nTrump is a deeply flawed candidate who will not personally manage the government. Instead, he will, as Obama and all presidents have done, outsource the direction of our vast federal enterprise. But on the issues noted above, his instincts â€“ and the instincts of those who are working with him -- are sounder than Clintonâ€™s are. And his designated hitters would be more likely to achieve the progress the country needs.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/08/17/Five-Reasons-Sane-Person-Might-Still-Vote-Trump\r\n\r\n________\r\n \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-layoffs-idUSKCN10T02R\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/\r\n\r\nTwitter: @batchelorshow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260c6be485545f08f5d2df91c711b5b6b3c52588","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+19+Dozen+Reasons+Voting+Trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260c6be485545f08f5d2df91c711b5b6b3c52588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,12,107,228,133,84,95,8,245,210,223,145,199,17,181,182,179,197,37,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
