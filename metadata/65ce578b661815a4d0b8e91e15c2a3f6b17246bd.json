Majoros, James R. Baker Jr. (Pan Stanford, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nIn recent decades, dendrimers â€” free-shaped synthetic macromolecules â€” have garnered a great deal of scientific interest because of their unique molecular nanostructure. Used in a variety of scientific applications, dendrimers are now widely regarded as a safer, more precise and more effective way to practice medicine.\r\n\r\nThis book compiles and details cutting-edge research in science and medicine from the interdisciplinary team of the Michigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences, which is currently revolutionizing drug delivery techniques through the development of engineered nanodevices. Edited by Istvan J. Majoros and James R. Baker Jr, two prominent nanotechnology researchers, this book will appeal to anyone involved in nanotechnology, macromolecular science, cancer therapy or drug delivery research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65ce578b661815a4d0b8e91e15c2a3f6b17246bd","amp;dn":"Dendrimer-Based+Nanomedicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65ce578b661815a4d0b8e91e15c2a3f6b17246bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,206,87,139,102,24,21,164,208,184,233,30,21,194,163,246,177,114,70,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
