What is to be done? @monica Crowley\r\n\r\nPollster Kellyanne Conway, who previously served as a Trump adviser, will step in as Trumpâ€™s campaign manager. Conway has been a fixture in the last three GOP primaries and counts Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trumpâ€™s running mate, among her many clients.\r\n\r\nThe two moves come at a critical time for Trump, who trails Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by double digits in some key swing states and has had a disastrous August.\r\n\r\nThe shifts signal Trumpâ€™s desire to jump-start his campaign, and the hiring of Bannon in particular suggest he intends to take a no-holds-barred approach in the 80-plus days before the election.\r\n\r\nBannon, described in a Bloomberg profile last year as the â€œmost dangerous political operative in America,â€ leads a right-wing news site that has been unapologetic in supporting Trump and attacking other Republicans â€” most notably Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).\r\n\r\nRyanâ€™s office declined to offer a comment on the hire.\r\n\r\nBannon is a former Navy officer who came from a Democratic household but began to embrace Reagan Republicanism after what he has described as former President Jimmy Carterâ€™s disastrous leadership of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter his military service, Bannon went to Harvard Business School and worked for Goldman Sachs in the late 1980s before launching his own boutique investment bank with a few colleagues in 1990. According to the Bloomberg profile, he made his fortune in part from falling into the entertainment industry, and accepting a stake in five television shows produced by Castle Rock Entertainment. One of the shows was â€œSeinfeld.â€\r\n\r\nAfter selling his investment firm, Bannon went to Hollywood, produced films and eventually met Andrew Breitbart, the founder of Breitbart News. Breitbart died in 2012, while Bannon was pitching investors on the siteâ€™s relaunch.\r\n\r\nUnder Bannon, Breitbart has been unabashedly pro-Trump.\r\n \nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/291715-meet-the-new-team-trump\r\n\r\nRepublican nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s recently unveiled economic plan was roundly praised for its aggressive pro-growth, job-creating proposals. He would cut income tax rates; increase exemptions for individuals; reduce the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three; slash the corporate tax to 15 percent, taking it from the highest in the developed world to nearly the lowest; and eliminate the death tax and the destructive alternative minimum tax. Dramatic tax reform is a political winner given the oppressive burdens imposed by the current Byzantine tax code.\r\n\r\nAs strong as Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan is, however, it doesnâ€™t adequately address something fundamental to truly bringing America back to full economic health: out-of-control government spending and the staggering national debt, currently racing toward $20 trillion and threatening to cripple the nation beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump believes â€” rightly â€” that the economic growth generated by his proposals will greatly reduce the debt burden. But given the magnitude of the debt, growth is necessary but not sufficient. Proposals to cut spending and reduce the debt may be unlikely to score Mr. Trump many votes, but they will demonstrate his seriousness about our long-term economic well-being, particularly when President Obama will add more than $8 trillion in debt, more than his 43 predecessors combined, and when Hillary Clinton is running on expanding the menu of taxpayer-subsidized freebies, from health care to college.\r\n \nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/17/trump-economic-plan-must-address-government-spendi/\r\n \nhttp://JohnBatchelorShow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef80d3b2625f9112898d8a839e741de48b8526ab","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+18+Manafort+Monica+Crowley.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef80d3b2625f9112898d8a839e741de48b8526ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,128,211,178,98,95,145,18,137,141,138,131,158,116,29,228,139,133,38,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
