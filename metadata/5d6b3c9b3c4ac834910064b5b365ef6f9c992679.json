Chakraborti, N. S. Dhalla (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nNa+-K+ ATPase or Na-pump ATPase, a member of â€œPâ€-type ATPase superfamily, is characterized by association of multiple isoforms mainly of itâ€™s Î±- and Î²- subunits. At present four different Î±- (Î±-1,Î±-2,Î±-3 and Î±-4) and three Î²- (Î²-1, Î²-2, and Î²-3) isoforms have been identified in mammalian cells and their differential expressions are tissue specific. Regulation of Na+-K+ ATPase activity is an important but a complex process, which involves short-term and long-term mechanisms. Short-term regulation of Na+-K+ ATPase is either mediated by changes in intracellular Na+ concentrations that directly affect the Na+-pump activity or by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-mediated by some stimulants leading to changes in its expression and transport properties. On the other hand, long-term regulation of Na+-K+ ATPase is mediated by hormones, such as mineralocorticoids and thyroid hormones, which cause changes in the transcription of genes of Î±- and Î²- subunits leading to an increased expression in the level of Na+-pump. Several studies have revealed a relatively new type of regulation that involves the association of small, single span membrane proteins with this enzyme. These proteins belong to the FXYD family, the members of which share a common signature sequence encompassing the transmembra\r\n\r\nne domain adjacent to the isoform(s) of Î±-Î² subunits of Na+-K+ ATPase. Considering the extraordinary importance of Na+-K+ ATPase in cellular function, several internationally established investigators have contributed their articles in the monograph entitled â€œRegulation of Membrane Na+-K+ ATPaseâ€ for inspiring young scientists and graduate students to enrich their knowledge on the enzyme, and we are sure that this book will soon be considered as a comprehensive scientific literature in the area of Na+-K+ ATPase regulation in health and disease","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d6b3c9b3c4ac834910064b5b365ef6f9c992679","amp;dn":"Regulation+of+Membrane+Na%2B-K%2B+ATPase+-+S.+Chakraborti%2C+N.+S.+Dha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d6b3c9b3c4ac834910064b5b365ef6f9c992679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,107,60,155,60,74,200,52,145,0,100,181,179,101,239,111,156,153,38,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
