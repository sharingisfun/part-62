While listeners searching for the original hit versions of these songs should look elsewhere, fans will relish finding the rare, unreleased, and newly recorded versions contained herein. Particular highlights include an a cappella take on Extreme's Beatlesque chart-topper &quot;More Than Words,&quot; which showcases the band's gorgeous vocal harmonies, and Night Ranger's &quot;Sister Christian,&quot; which matches the original's chugging intensity, despite the absence of Jeff Watson and Brad Gillis's wall of guitars. Also of note is Queensryche's &quot;Silent Lucidity,&quot; which stripped to its live essence, sounds even more reminiscent of Pink Floyd. In every case, these tracks reveal that the heavy-metal scene produced some of the most enduring pure pop of the '80s.\r\n\r\nVH1 CLASSIC PRESENTS METAL MANIA: STRIPPED!:\r\n1.
