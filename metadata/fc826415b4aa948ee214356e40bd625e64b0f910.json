I have done all the necessary patching, so there is no fooling with IPS or UPS files required. I made this because many people have problems figuring out how to patch their roms. Included with the roms are two emulators that I use, ZSNES (the one that I mainly use, because it has extremely low system requirements,) and SNES9x (which plays some games more accurately than ZSNES.) There are two versions of SNES9x included, the Windows 32 bit version for XP and up, and the Windows 9x version for Windows ME and Windows 98. I downloaded the patches for these games from [urlhttp://www.romhacking.net[/url]. You can find a few more translated games on that site that I did not include here. Per a private message request I have included all of the other Gundam games that were not present in my previous two torrents. I was also asked about any other Super Robot Wars translations and looked around, but could not find any other games for the SNES that were completed. There is a SRW for the PSX that has been translated, but this is a SNES rom torrent. SRW 4 and SRW EX are close, but I am holding off on a torrent release of them until more work is done.\r\n\r\nThe roms included are:\r\n\r\nBall Bullet Gun.smc\r\nCyborg 009.smc\r\nDossun! - Stone Battle.smc\r\nDream Maze - The Kigurumi Adventure.smc\r\nGundam Wing - Endless Duel.smc\r\nGunman's Proof.smc\r\nHoly Umbrella - Dondera's Wild.smc\r\nKunio Kun Dodgeball.smc\r\nMadou Monogatari - Big Kindergarten Kids.smc\r\nMickey and Donald - Magical Adventure 3.smc\r\nMobile Fighter G Gundam.smc\r\nMysterious Dungeon 2 - Shiren the Wanderer.smc\r\nPretty Soldier Sailor Moon - Another Story.smc\r\nRiver City Ransom 2.smc\r\nSanrio World Smash Ball.smc\r\nSlayers.SMC\r\nSnoopy Concert.smc\r\nStar Fox 2.smc\r\nTactics Ogre - Let Us Cling Together.smc\r\nUmihara Kawase.smc\r\nV Gundam.smc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc826415b4aa948ee214356e40bd625e64b0f910","amp;dn":"Translated+Japanese+SNES+roms+Part+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc826415b4aa948ee214356e40bd625e64b0f910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,130,100,21,180,170,148,142,226,20,53,110,64,189,98,94,100,176,249,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
