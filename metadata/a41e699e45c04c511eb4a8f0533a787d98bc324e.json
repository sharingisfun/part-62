Trump.\r\n\r\nDespite the left's excuses, Clinton violated federal law\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Friday, Twitter provided a near-perfect window into Americaâ€™s divided, polarized soul. That afternoon, the FBI released its heavily redacted report and interview notes regarding Hillary Clintonâ€™s e-mails, and the responses could not have been more different. The Right side of the Twitterverse melted down. Some of the revelations were stunning. Hillaryâ€™s team wiped her server after the New York Times disclosed its existence â€” at the same time that Hillary herself was publicly calling for the release of her e-mails to the public. Incredibly, Hillary told investigators that she didnâ€™t pay attention to the â€œlevelâ€ of classification attached to e-mail communications and didnâ€™t know what the (C) classification meant. She conveniently â€œforgotâ€ numerous key facts. And â€” finally â€” though she used 13 e-mail-capable mobile devices during her tenure as secretary of state, her lawyers were unable to locate any of them. Thus, the FBI was unable to conduct a forensic examination and was unable to definitely determine if her e-mail had been hacked. In short, what the FBI file revealed was the extent of the Clinton deception operation, complete with lurid details â€” such as aides smashing old Blackberries with a hammer, an IT employee declaring an â€œoh s***â€ moment as he rushed to delete files, and Cheryl Mills participating as an attorney in the proceedings even though she was a witness and possible subject in the investigation.\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/b/Despite-the-lefts-excuses,-Clinton-violated-federal-law/752669190683830372.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41e699e45c04c511eb4a8f0533a787d98bc324e","amp;dn":"Laura-Ingraham-Show-Podcast+Sept+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41e699e45c04c511eb4a8f0533a787d98bc324e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,30,105,158,69,192,76,81,30,180,168,240,83,58,120,125,152,188,50,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
