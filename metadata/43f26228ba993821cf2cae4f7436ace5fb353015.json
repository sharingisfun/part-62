It's about defeating the Democrat Party and what they stand for.  Because, as I sit here, I don't care, you take any of the 16 or 17 people that sought the Republican nomination, and there's not a one of them I would not have voted for over Hillary Clinton, if it came down to it. That's what this has always been about to me.  It's greater than my personal preferences over ideology and so forth.  It's bigger to me than party.  The country's always been bigger than party, to me.  We have 70% of the American people admitting, in a lot of polls, they think the country's going in the wrong direction.  Well, we can build on that.  \r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f26228ba993821cf2cae4f7436ace5fb353015","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+August+11%2C+2016.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f26228ba993821cf2cae4f7436ace5fb353015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,242,98,40,186,153,56,33,207,44,174,79,116,54,172,229,251,53,48,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
