When I knew about it I was astounded that it wasn't on TPB, so here it is for sharing it. The bad news is that the only version I could find is this one with Portuguese subtitles embedded. So if anyone can link some proper subtitles that would be nice.\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894ea1fb14f5f0df69fdb90bf0e8c8dd4a3fae0e","amp;dn":"Location+Africa.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894ea1fb14f5f0df69fdb90bf0e8c8dd4a3fae0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,78,161,251,20,245,240,223,105,253,185,11,240,232,200,221,74,63,174,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
