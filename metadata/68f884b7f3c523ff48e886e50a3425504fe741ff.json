No funds to manage or infrastructures to build. Itâ€™s a kill or be killed battle of rapid decisions to dominate the gene pool.\r\n\r\nKepler 42-C. A faraway planet of little significance. At least, it was until a malfunctioning drone crashed into its ocean, forever altering the course of life and inciting a battle to claim the planet, one microorganism at a time.\r\n\r\nClaim vital positions to replicate and mutate into seven specialized units, such as the fast and vulnerable Scout, the explosive Kamikaze, and the life-draining Leach. Press your enemies for weaknesses, outflank their ambushes, usurp their bases, and amass an unstoppable swarm to overpower your adversaries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f884b7f3c523ff48e886e50a3425504fe741ff","amp;dn":"Boid+v0.9.046","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f884b7f3c523ff48e886e50a3425504fe741ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,248,132,183,243,197,35,255,72,232,134,229,10,52,37,80,79,231,65,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
