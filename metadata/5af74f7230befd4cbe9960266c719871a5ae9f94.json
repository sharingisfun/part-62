Steam Days S01E01 - Travels with a Duchess\r\nFirst transmitted in 1986, Miles Kington takes a closer look at the 'Duchess of Hamilton', one of Britain's most famous locomotives. The presenter meets Kim Maylon, the principal engineer who looked after the locomotive at the National Railway Museum in York, and is shown the work involved to prepare the engine for its epic trip. He then travels behind the Duchess over the famous Settle to Carlisle line.\r\n\r\n2. Steam Days S01E02 - Going Great Western\r\nFirst transmitted in 1986, Miles Kington explores the line laid from Bristol to Exeter by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and then travels through south Devon in all its glory.\r\n\r\nAlong the way Kington examines the enormous task faced by Brunel in the design and construction of the Royal Albert Bridge, which carries the Cornish Main Line railway in and out of Cornwall. Perhaps less well known is the impact of the railway line and the rail company on promoting tourism in the Edwardian golden age of British seaside resorts.\r\n\r\n3. Steam Days S01E03 A Tale of Two Scotsmen\r\nFirst transmitted in 1986, Miles Kington tries to find out why the name 'Flying Scotsman' has been exciting travellers and enthusiasts for so long, and meets the people who are determined to preserve its image today.\r\n\r\n4. Steam Days S01E04 The Quest for Speed\r\nFirst transmitted in 1986, Miles Kington looks at three locomotives, including the â€˜City of Truroâ€™ and â€˜Sir Nigel Gresleyâ€™, which played a part in keeping Britain on the tracks towards the world speed record. In conversation with John Bellwood from the National Railway Museum in York, Kington reflects on the pros and cons of Patrick Stirlingâ€™s Single Wheeler locomotive.\r\n\r\n5. Steam Days S01E05 The Fishing Line\r\nFirst transmitted in 1986, Miles Kington experiences the power of a London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) Stanier 'Black Five' on a journey from Fort William across the western Highlands via Glenfinnan to Mallaig.\r\n\r\nWhile observing breathtaking scenery and stunning engineering achievements, including Glenfinnan viaduct, Kington uncovers what the West Highland Line meant to the traditional crofting communities that had been devastated by the Highland clearances.\r\n\r\n6. Steam Days S01E06 Workhorses\r\nFirst transmitted in 1986, Miles Kington looks at freight trains - the workhorses of Britain's railways - and the pattern of their usage before motorways. He examines the role of the British Rail Standard Class 9F steam locomotive, one of the most powerful to run on British railways, and hitches a lift in the cab of 92203 'Black Prince'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia info:-\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media\r\nCodec ID : isom (isom/iso2/avc1/mp41)\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\r\nOverall bit rate : 1 503 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 2 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 1 404 Kbps\r\nWidth : 832 pixels\r\nHeight : 468 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.144\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 29mn 38s\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nFrame rate : 46.875 fps (1024 spf)\r\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af74f7230befd4cbe9960266c719871a5ae9f94","amp;dn":"Steam+Days+%28BBC+steam+train+docu%2C+1986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af74f7230befd4cbe9960266c719871a5ae9f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,247,79,114,48,190,253,76,190,153,96,38,108,113,152,113,165,174,159,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
