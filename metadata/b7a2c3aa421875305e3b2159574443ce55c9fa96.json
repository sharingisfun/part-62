The ideas for all three movements appear in its opening pages. Alwyn proposed the influence of Schoenberg by asserting that the symphony worked with all twelve tones of the chromatic scale, but in a tonal way. Walton had done the same thing earlier in his second symphony, and it could be argued that Vaughan Williams (in his Symphony No. 4) and, in the United States Virgil Thomson and Stravinsky, far more knowingly in the Forties, had preceded him. In none of these cases, however, is the influence of Schoenberg all that apparent, and I believe it's misguided to think of &quot;composing with twelve tones&quot; in this way. Far more importantly, if a composer uses a highly chromatic idiom anyway, sooner or later he quite easily thinks about how to organize as many notes of the scale as possible. Schoenberg got composers thinking along more systematic lines, even composers who never lost tonality. Indeed, one might contend that Schoenberg's deepest influence wasn't on twelve-tone composers at all. In England, for example, Schoenberg influenced Britten more deeply than he did Humphrey Searle, although Searle wrote full-blown dodecaphonic works. Alwyn did become interested enough in Schoenberg's method to adopt it in his String Trio eight years later, with much of the same aesthetic as well. At this point, however, Walton, not Schoenberg, dominates. If Walton doesn't give you fits, you will have no problems with this symphony.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nAll transfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
