Black Legion of Detroit. @gordongchang, @thadmccotte\r\nChina is prepared to do whatever it takes to write its own navigation rules in South China Sea, including the setting of â€œred linesâ€ for neighborhood countries. Back in June, for instance, China warned Japan â€œnot send Self-Defense Forces to join U.S. operations that test the freedom of navigation in the disputed South China Sea,â€ according to a Japan Times editorial.\r\n\r\nJapan seems to be defiant of Chinaâ€™s warning. â€œThe Japanese government has no plans to join the freedom of navigation operations, in which the United States since October has sent warships near artificial islands that China has built in the South China Seaâ€ explains the same editorial. â€œBut it has left room for sending SDF ships to the disputed waters to protect U.S. ships under new security laws that have expanded SDF roles overseas.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2016/08/21/china-sets-a-red-line-for-japan-in-south-china-sea/#7df7d19c5b87\r\n\r\n______________\r\n\r\nThe Black Legion was a secret vigilante white supremacist organization in the Midwest of the United States that splintered from the Ku Klux Klan and operated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The white paramilitary group was founded in the 1920s by William Shepard in east central Ohio in the Appalachian region, as a security force known as the Black Guard to protect Ku Klux Klan officers.[1][2] The Legion became active in chapters throughout Ohio. One of its self-described leaders, Virgil &quot;Bert&quot; Effinger, lived and worked in Lima, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1931 a chapter was formed in Highland Park, Michigan, expanding to an estimated total membership in the state estimated between 20,000 and 30,000 by the mid-1930s during the Great Depression. Its members were generally native-born Protestant men, many who had migrated from the South. One third of the members lived in Detroit, which had also been a strong center of KKK activity in the 1920s. In May 1936 Charles A. Poole, a Works Progress Administration organizer, was kidnapped from home by a gang of the Black Legion and murdered in southwest Detroit. Authorities arrested and prosecuted a gang of twelve men affiliated with the Legion. Dayton Dean pleaded guilty and testified against numerous other members; ten others were convicted of the murder. Dean and the others were all sentenced to life in prison. One man was acquitted.[1]\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Legion_(political_movement)\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3073467a6c13d0b144c871112a39bc23b41531","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+22+China+Bullies+Japan.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3073467a6c13d0b144c871112a39bc23b41531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,48,115,70,122,108,19,208,177,68,200,113,17,42,57,188,35,180,21,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
