Brought up in the Victorian Era she strives to be more than just a woman of marriageable age. She becomes enamored with Thomas Sharpe, a mysterious stranger. After a series of meetings and incidents she marries Thomas and comes to live with him and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe, far away from everything she has known. The naive girl soon comes to realize not everything is as it appears as ghosts of the past quite literally come out of the woodwork. This movie is more about mystery and suspense than gore.\r\n\r\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\r\nWriters: Guillermo del Toro, Matthew Robbins\r\nStars: Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11280453e2c9548bc1777950ea05c7a666414b69","amp;dn":"Crimson.Peak.2015.720p.HD-TS.x264.AC3.HQ+%28GR+SRT%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11280453e2c9548bc1777950ea05c7a666414b69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,40,4,83,226,201,84,139,193,119,121,80,234,5,199,166,102,65,75,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
