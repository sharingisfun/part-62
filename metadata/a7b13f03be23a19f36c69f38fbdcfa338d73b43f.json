China Aims to Militarize the Moon. @gordongchang. James Holmes, @navalwarcollege. Rick Fisher. @cleopaskal, Chatham House. Henry Sokolsk\r\nAugust 12,2016\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦The Clausewitzian formula helps strategists determine when to abandon an enterprise short of attaining their aims. The cost of those aims may come to exceed the value of the political object, or the value assigned the political object may fall. In either case, the original goals no longer justify the expenditure of resources. Strategists should be prepared to revise their calculations to determine whether the enterprise is still worth its price. If not, Clausewitz warns them to shut down the endeavorâ€”conserving what gains they can while cutting their losses.\r\n\r\nLogic thus demands that decision-makers constantly tune the balance between a ventureâ€™s sunk and potential costs and the expected rewards of achieving the political objective. When cost/benefit logic no longer warrants political, economic, and military commitments, triaging the burden becomes the goalâ€”even if it means altering political aims significantly, and even at the cost of reneging on pledges to allies.\r\n\r\nMaintaining dominance in the international system over time, then, requires a great power capable of reconciling its national interests with its obligations to other states. Thatâ€™s the essence of the rational calculus that is supposed to dominate the decision-making process.\r\n \nhttp://nationalinterest.org/feature/welcome-the-age-strategic-triage-17450?page=2\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦The proposed facility, which may include quarters for astronauts and a powerful radar antenna array at least 50 metres high, could monitor wider areas of our planet than existing satellites, according to scientists involved in the study.\r\n\r\nThe base, which would be used for scientific research and defence monitoring, could also produce more powerful and clearer images of earth as the high-frequency microwaves emitted by the radar station could not only penetrate cloud, but also the earthâ€™s surface, allowing it to monitor areas on land, under the sea and underground.\r\n\r\nLeading space scientists in China have joined the radar station project.\r\n\r\nThe team held a two-day brainstorming session at the Fragrant Hill Hotel in Beijing last month.\r\n\r\nThose taking part included Yan Jun, the director of the National Astronomical Observatories; Professor Lin Yangting, a planetary researcher whose team discovered evidence of coal-like carbon in an asteroid; and senior scientists from Chinaâ€™s unmanned lunar exploration missionsâ€¦.â€\r\n\r\nHe suggested the moon had numerous advantages over satellites or a space station as an earth observation platform, including stability and the unlimited durability of any complex on the lunar surface.\r\n\r\nThe data collected by lunar radar would help with a wide range of scientific research issues such as monitoring extreme weather conditions, global earthquake activity, agricultural production and the collapse of the polar ice caps, he wrote.\r\n\r\nTo generate high intensity radio beams that could reach earth, the radar station would need an enormous amount of power so a solar or nuclear power plant would have to be built, Guo said in the paper.\r\n \nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2006611/chinese-scientists-study-viability-manned-radar-station\r\n\r\nUnderestimated: Our Not So Peaceful Nuclear Future (Black and White Version) by Henry Sokolski\r\n \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nuclearpower-idUSKCN10L0CX\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b13f03be23a19f36c69f38fbdcfa338d73b43f","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+24+China+Militarize+Moon.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b13f03be23a19f36c69f38fbdcfa338d73b43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,177,63,3,190,35,161,159,54,198,159,56,251,220,250,51,141,115,180,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
