In his lifetime, he had several champions but stood outside the musical mainstream, with his large-scaled, expressively grim scores. A Honegger pupil, his life wasn't easy: a violent, alcoholic father, and a mid-life diagnosis of crippling arthritis. Still, he continued composing to the end. His entire symphonic legacy--effectively 15, since the first and seven th were unfinished--have now been recorded complete, though a few have multiple recordings to their credit.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
