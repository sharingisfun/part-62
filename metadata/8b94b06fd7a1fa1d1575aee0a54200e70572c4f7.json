They spend some time together and Karen teaches Lonnie some of her favorite pastimes, like make-up, shop-lifting, skipping school and lying to her parents about it, but confessing to the priest later. But Karen also learns some honesty from Lonnie. A film about social differences and growing up.\r\n\r\nHosted at: Archive.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b94b06fd7a1fa1d1575aee0a54200e70572c4f7","amp;dn":"Old+Enough+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b94b06fd7a1fa1d1575aee0a54200e70572c4f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,148,176,111,215,161,250,29,21,117,174,224,165,66,0,231,5,114,196,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
