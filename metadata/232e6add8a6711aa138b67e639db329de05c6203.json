Smart Move\r\nJason Riley - Wall Street Journal\r\nDonald Trump is taking lumps for his clumsy and crude &quot;What the hell do you have to lose?&quot; black outreach effort. Black voters, until recently, seem to have been an afterthought for the Republican presidential nominee, who is much more focused on turning out the millions of white voters who supported John McCain in 2008 but stayed home when Mitt Romney ran four years later.\r\nClinton's Inescapable Cloud of Corruption\r\nLisa Boothe - Washington Examiner\r\nWhile many in the media have declared the presidential election all but over, damning accusations of pay to play at the Clinton Foundation and reports that the FBI found 15,000 work-related documents that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over represent the political land mines that still lie between her and the presidency. Multiple ongoing Freedom of Information Act civil suits, perjury allegations, an IRS probe and alleged joint U.S. Attorney-FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation represent the inescapable cloud of corruption that could be the Democratic nominee's undoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 24, 2016 9:55 AM\r\nHillary and Huma Abedin peddle corruptionNational Review: \r\n\r\nHuma Abedin must be a remarkable woman: She has held down four of the worst jobs in politics, several of them simultaneously: right hand to Hillary Rodham Clinton, fixer and patron-patronizer for the Clinton Foundation, an editor of a journal spawned by a major al-Qaeda financier, and wife to Anthony Weiner. Mrs. Carlos Danger has some explaining to do. So does Mrs. Clinton. More, in fact.\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/b/WaPo:-U.S.-needs-illegal-immigrants-for-washing-dishes,-mowing-lawns/761637221708330535.html\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:232e6add8a6711aa138b67e639db329de05c6203","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingraham+Aug+24+Conservative+Talk+Radio.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"232e6add8a6711aa138b67e639db329de05c6203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,46,106,221,138,103,17,170,19,139,103,230,57,219,50,157,224,92,98,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
