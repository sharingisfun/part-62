Through the medium of the &quot;Comments&quot; the editors hope to make it easy and enticing for the specialist in a given area of inorganic chemistry - synthesis, structure, spectroscopy, kinetics and mechanisms, theory - to write about their interests. Younger inorganic chemists, in particular, whose research is not widely known, are encouraged to describe their work in â€œCommentsâ€. Since a &quot;Comment&quot; is an expert guide to the important progress in individual fields, articles from senior authors in any science field, with personal points of view appropriate to inorganic chemistry, are welcome. Reviews of topics important to the advancement of inorganic chemistry are especially solicited. From time to time, comments on topical conferences may be included. While all contributions are solicited by the editors, potential authors are encouraged to write the editors or a member of the Editorial Board of their interest in doing an article. The articles are reviewed by experts and members of the Editorial Board for their quality and appropriateness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f58d0da552b570b39a1a507951bfd3246bfa44","amp;dn":"Comments+on+Inorganic+Chemistry+%281981-2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f58d0da552b570b39a1a507951bfd3246bfa44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,245,141,13,165,82,181,112,179,154,26,80,121,81,191,211,36,107,250,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
