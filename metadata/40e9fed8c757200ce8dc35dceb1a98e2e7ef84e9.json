Growlanser 2 and 3 were later bundled together as Growlanser: Generations.\r\n\r\nPro tips for Growlanser 2 (if you use emulators): \r\n1: That game has some serious problems with saves. As soon as you get to the world map- save! If your save has a bad date stamp (like 00/00) LOAD it and then SAVE again. Repeat until you get normal date stamp. Later save as often as possible and if date stamp changes to 00/00 repeat the load/save process.\r\n\r\n2: Disable spells animations- they sometimes may freeze the game\r\n\r\n3: Game sometimes freezes after story battle (those that ends with &quot;Mission clear/complete&quot; animation). Save using save states just before that animation and if game freezes- reload until it's fine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40e9fed8c757200ce8dc35dceb1a98e2e7ef84e9","amp;dn":"Growlanser+1-3+%5BPS2%5D%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40e9fed8c757200ce8dc35dceb1a98e2e7ef84e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,233,254,216,199,87,32,12,232,220,53,220,235,26,152,226,231,239,132,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
