Get ready to slap your genetics in the face.\r\nEach month's workout is more than just an instructional video of how to perform proper technique. It's an opportunity to see the intensity applied to each month's workout to pump you up.\r\nIf you're ever lacking motivation you'll get the perfect idea of how to break though it after witnessing the intensity and determination as the cameras follow your coaches through a genuine 'no holds barred' all-out workout.\r\nThe Hypertrophy M.A.X.
