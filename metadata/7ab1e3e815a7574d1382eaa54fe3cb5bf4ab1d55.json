Trump, or at least stage a public protest against him.\r\n\r\nThese Republicans are in denial, and so are the conservative writers and activists egging them on. Their insurrection is likely to fizzle. It also ignores the true problem, and conservatives should thank Mr. Trump for exposing it.\r\n\r\nFor many years â€” in fact, for much of its modern history â€” the G.O.P. has made a fetish of ideological rectitude at the expense of meeting the needs of voters. It is Mr. Trump who is finally addressing their real economic concerns.\r\n\r\nWilliam Johnson - Executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. &quot;It does seem that there is a double standard and that is particularly true when it comes to police&quot; Jack Cashill - Author of TWA 800: \r\n\r\n\r\n    William Johnson - Executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations.\r\n    Mark Fuhrman - Forensic and crime scene expert for FOX News Channel and former LAPD detective.\r\n    Jack Cashill - Author of TWA 800: The Crash, The Cover Up, and The Conspiracy.\r\n    Mary Matalin - Republican political consultant\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/\r\nThe Victims of the Dallas Police Massacre \r\n\r\nLie of the Day\r\nGo look at a Trump product.
