They even inspired bootleggers, who released Another Stoney Evening, drawn from one of their 1971 shows. Hence the title of this belated official release, drawn from a different show at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on October 10. Working with acoustic guitars and piano, they sang some of their more popular CSNY songs (&quot;DÃ©jÃ  Vu,&quot; &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;), as well as tunes from their solo albums and songs that would turn up on their duo album the following year. Boasting of having &quot;the loosest show on earth&quot; and making cryptic drug references, they nevertheless sang and played well, overcoming with enthusiasm and craft the relative weaknesses of some of the material -- Crosby's formlessness, Nash's preciousness. And the camaraderie they shared with each other and their audience even allowed them a certain imperiousness, such as when the drugged performers lectured the drugged audience on how to clap on the right beat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07131a2dbb00c2e73026255db174f5533a8a9d40","amp;dn":"Crosby+%26amp%3B+Nash+-+Another+Stoney+Evening%2C+FLAC+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07131a2dbb00c2e73026255db174f5533a8a9d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,19,26,45,187,0,194,231,48,38,37,93,177,116,245,83,58,138,157,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
