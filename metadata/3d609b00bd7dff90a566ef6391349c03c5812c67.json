It Works Even if youâ€™re not a â€œnaturalâ€ writer Even if you donâ€™t have a huge email list Even if youâ€™re stretched thin with a million to-dos\t\r\n\r\nAnd most business owners\r\nskip right over it.\r\nIn 2010, I wrote this email to promote a new product weâ€™d created. I wrote it. I agonized over it. I threw it away and started again. And finally, when it was ready, I clicked send.\r\nWithin 24 hours, that email pulled in hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\nBut thatâ€™s just the beginning.\r\nSince 2010, this email has been invisibly running in our systems. During that time, it has automatically generated millions of dollars â€” just that one email.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s a sales report from 5 years later:\r\n\r\nSame email. Same copy\r\nThe millions weâ€™ve earned from that one email has allowed me to aggressively invest in myself and my business. I used that money to train with the best mentors I could find. I hired the best designers, the best project managers, the best support team. That money allows me to advertise and acquire even more customers, and build even better products. This is what business people call a â€œvirtuous cycle.â€\r\nIâ€™d like to show you how to build that virtuous cycle into your business so you stand out, get more customers, and generate more revenueâ€¦for the exact same work.\r\nRevenue Growth\r\n\r\nThe power of great copy: IWT Revenue Growth 2009-2014\r\nAlong the way, Iâ€™m going to challenge the way you think about growing your business. Hint: So many people think about getting new customers and building products, but completely neglectâ€¦\r\n\r\nTHE HIDDEN LEVER FOR GROWING YOUR BUSINESS\r\nThereâ€™s a highly overlooked strategy to grow your businessâ€¦one that most business owners overlook.\r\nEvery day, you and I have a million different options on how we can grow our businesses:\r\n\r\nFind more traffic\r\nConvert more customers\r\nBuild more products\r\nRedesign our website\r\nSplit-test our confirmation page\r\n\r\nAnd on and on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d609b00bd7dff90a566ef6391349c03c5812c67","amp;dn":"Ramit+Sethi+-+Call+to+Action+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d609b00bd7dff90a566ef6391349c03c5812c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,96,155,0,189,125,255,144,165,102,239,99,145,52,156,3,197,129,44,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
