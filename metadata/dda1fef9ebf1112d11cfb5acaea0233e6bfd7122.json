But lately another question has been preoccupying us: If Trump does lose, can the Republican Party survive?\r\n\r\nWill seemed to think so back in April, when he claimed that if Trump loses big, â€œRepublicans working to purge him and his manner from public life will reap the considerable satisfaction of preserving the identity of their 162-year-old party.â€ Will himself publicly rejected that identity two months later, telling PJMedia he was no longer a Republican. But anyway our question isnâ€™t about whether the Republican â€œidentityâ€ can survive; itâ€™s whether the party can.\r\n\r\nA basic function of a political party is to unify behind a nominee, and the GOP has conspicuously failed to do so this year. In the first debate, in August 2015, the most memorable moment not involving Rosie Oâ€™Donnell came when moderator Bret Baier called for a show of hands: â€œIs there anyone on stage . . . who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person? . . . Raise your hand now if you wonâ€™t make that pledge tonightâ€ (emphasis ours)â€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/if-trump-loses-can-the-gop-survive-1471975306\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dda1fef9ebf1112d11cfb5acaea0233e6bfd7122","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+23+Day+After+Trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dda1fef9ebf1112d11cfb5acaea0233e6bfd7122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,161,254,249,235,241,17,45,17,207,181,172,174,160,35,62,107,253,113,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
