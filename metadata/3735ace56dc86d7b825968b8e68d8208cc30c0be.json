Set in the fictional world of Alagaesia, the novels focus on the adventures of a teenage boy named Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, as they struggle to overthrow the evil king Galbatorix. The series was originally intended to be a trilogy (named the &quot;Inheritance Trilogy&quot;) until Paolini announced on October 30, 2007, while working on the third novel, that he believed the story was too complex to conclude in just three books.\r\n\r\nThe book series as a whole received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has gained both popularity and commercial success. The first book in the series, Eragon, was originally self-published by Paolini in 2001, and subsequently re-published by Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers on June 25, 2003. The second book in the series, Eldest, was published by Knopf on August 23, 2005. Both were New York Times bestsellers. The third book in the series, Brisingr, was published by Knopf on September 20, 2008. The fourth and final book in the series, Inheritance, was published by Knopf on November 8, 2011. The series has sold 33.5 million copies worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATS: ABBYY GZ, DAISY, EPUB, FULL TEXT, KINDLE, PDF, SINGLE PAGE PROCESSED JP2 ZIP\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIF YOU LIKE THIS, PLEASE RESPECT THE COMUNITY AND SEED THE \r\nMATERIAL ! ! !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3735ace56dc86d7b825968b8e68d8208cc30c0be","amp;dn":"Christopher+Paolini+-+The+Inheritance+Cycle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3735ace56dc86d7b825968b8e68d8208cc30c0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,53,172,229,109,200,109,123,130,89,104,184,230,141,130,8,204,48,192,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
