Though it was not as successful as Picha's previous film, it was entered into the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. In 1984, an American dub was released known as B.C. Rock. It was released in select theaters and home video by Almi Pictures. Major changes to the film included newly written dialogue by the comedy duo The Funny Boys (Vallely and Schmock), recut footage, different voices, different instrumental score, the absence of the narrator (with the main character telling the story), and nearly all the songs written and performed by Leo Sayer have been replaced by songs by other artists, in order to attract a wider audience. Though several bootleg DVDs are available online, there are currently no plans for an official DVD release. Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein, future founders of The Weinstein Company, are billed as &quot;Music Talent Consultants&quot;. Relative newcomer Miramax Films received a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; billing.\r\n\r\nSongs by:\r\nClarence Clemons\r\nAlan Brewer\r\nRick Derringer\r\nGenesis\r\nHall and Oates\r\nKevin Kelly\r\nAnna Pepper\r\nLeo Sayer\r\nSteel Breeze\r\nTriumph\r\nRick Wakeman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ef35f2434cd66be234f37c227d31bbcdc073ce","amp;dn":"B.C.+Rock+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ef35f2434cd66be234f37c227d31bbcdc073ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,239,53,242,67,76,214,107,226,52,243,124,34,125,49,187,205,192,115,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
